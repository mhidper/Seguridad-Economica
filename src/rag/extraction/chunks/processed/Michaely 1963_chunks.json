Michaely's \n study records the commodity and geographic concentration coefficients and the \n commodity- and geographically-weighted shares of both exports and imports \n for 44 non-Communist countries for a \"representative\" postwar year, 1954. \n His basic data are the United Nations' compilation of the value of traded \n goods classified according to a 150 commodity group breakdown. \n To marshall and generalize from these data, Michaely has computed a \n number of ingeniously devised indexes designed to portray neglected structural \n characteristics of international trade. A brief description of his concept of a \n commodity-weighted share will give some flavor of the novelty of his approach. \n He contends, with merit, that the relevant export share is not the conventional \n one of a country's share in total world exports; rather it is the country's share",

Michaely \n is correspondingly perceptive in conceiving indexes of other significant struc- \n tural phenomena. It is apparent, then, that this is an intriguing treatment of \n international trade patterns. \n The study goes beyond mere reporting, however. Michaely finds support in \n his calculations for the a priori view that a country typically tends to be \n relatively specialized in its export goods and diversified in the commodities it \n imports.
