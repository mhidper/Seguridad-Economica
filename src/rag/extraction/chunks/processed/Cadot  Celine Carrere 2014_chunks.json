How much access there is for\ndeveloping countries on OECD markets has been the subject of considerableattention from a policy angle (see e.g. Kee et al. 2009 and references therein). By\ncontrast, to our knowledge, not much has been written on the outcome—the overallevolution and composition of OECD imports. Yet, it matters whether they areopening up in the sense of letting more extra-OECD exporters in, or concentratingon a few ‘‘preferred’’ suppliers. Contestable OECD markets would make it easier forentrants to get a foothold; in contrast, if they exhibited strong incumbency",

Incolumn (7) of Table 3the coefﬁcient on time squared loses its signiﬁcance when\nChina is excluded from the sample, suggesting that China is indeed driving theobserved re-concentration. Using our SITC data for China we calculated thecontribution of the intensive and extensive margin to China-OECD imports growthover the 1963–2006 period. While in the early years (1963–1975) the extensive\nmargin accounted for about 35 % of China-OECD imports growth, this share shrank\nto almost zero in the 1993–2006 period. This conﬁrms that the increasedconcentration of OECD imports on China occurs at the intensive margin: In recentyears, no new product line opened between China and its OECD trade partners.\nThus, although their imports are increasingly concentrating on Chinese products,",

Overall, excluding China,\nOECD imports are becoming more diversiﬁed across time as predicted by ourquality search model with an increasing number of potential suppliers.\n4 Concluding remarks\nLooking at the evolution of OECD imports at a high degree of disaggregation (over\na thousand product lines) over the forty-year period where data is available, we ﬁndstriking evidence of geographical diversiﬁcation at the product level. That is, OECDcountries have been sourcing each of their imported products from an increasingly\nlarge pool of suppliers. We also ﬁnd evidence of a geographical re-concentration of",

Put together, these observations lend support to amodel of quality search by OECD buyers generating alternating periods ofconcentration and diversiﬁcation, discussed in Sect. 2of this paper. Our quality-\nsearch approach suggests that the contestability of OECD markets varies across timeand products, with periods of closed doors, characterized by strong incumbencyadvantages, alternating with periods of open door, characterized by contestability.\nIn terms or policy implications, our results highlight the importance of raising\nexporter quality-management capacities in developing countries, as periods of opendoor appear to be essentially periods of quality search.",
