We used two different approaches to this\nquestion.

A high density value\nmeans that the kth country has many developed\nproducts surrounding the jth product. To study the\nevolution of comparative advantage, we con-sidered “transition products ”as those with an\nRCA c,i< 0.5 in 1990 and an RCA c,i> 1 in 1995. As\na control, we considered “undeveloped products ”\nthose that in 1990 and 1995 had an RCA c,i<0 . 5\nand disregarded those cases not fitting any of\nthese two criteria.
