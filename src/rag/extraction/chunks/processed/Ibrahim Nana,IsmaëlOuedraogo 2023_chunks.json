Introduction  \nDespite the decrease in transportation and transaction costs , distance remains a key determinant \nof international trade  relations . Traditional gravity models, widely used to study bilateral trade, have \nshed light on the influence of physical distance and cultural ties on trade flows (Baltagi et al., 2003; Egger, \n2000; Silva and Tenreyro, 2006; Zhou, 2011) .
