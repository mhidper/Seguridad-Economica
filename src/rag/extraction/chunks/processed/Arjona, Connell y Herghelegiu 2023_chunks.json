First, \nover the last decades, there has been a continuous process of de-industrialization \nthat led to a loss of manufacturing capacity in the EU and other high-income \neconomies, particularly for industries based on cost competitiveness and with low \nproductive investments (Vu et al., 2021).

Third, a progressive shift in dependencies occurs as \na result of the current energy transition. In this regard, the EU is moving away from \nfossil fuels, for which Eastern Europe has traditionally been a key EU provider, into \nraw materials, where EU demand has conventionally been met by supply from \nforeign markets.7 In this respect, the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2021) \nforecasts an insufficient raw material supply to cover global demand in inputs such as \ncobalt, which is essential to develop batteries.
