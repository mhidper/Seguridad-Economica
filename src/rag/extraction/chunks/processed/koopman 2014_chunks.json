Our parsimonious framework bridges a gap between official trade statistics ( in gross value terms) \nand national accounts ( in value-added terms) , and integrates all pre-\nvious measures of vertical specialization and value-added trade in the literature into a unified framework. To illustrate the potential of such a method,  we present a number of applications including re-comput-\ning revealed comparative advantages and the magnifying impact of multi-stage production on trade costs.

In mathematical terms, it can be expressed as\n(1)  VS =  A \nM (I −  A D  ) −1 E.\n (ii) A second measure, also proposed by HIY (2001) and labeled as VS1, looks at \nvertical specialization from the export side, and measures the value of inter -\nmediate exports sent indirectly through third countries to final destinations. \nHowever, HIY did not provide a mathematical definition for VS1.\n (iii) A third measure is the value of a country’s exported goods that are used \nas imported inputs by the rest of the world to produce final goods that are shipped back to home.

First, the production for \nits exports may contain foreign value added or imported intermediate goods (a). \nSecond, part of the domestic value added that is exported may return home after \nbeing embodied in the imported foreign goods rather than being absorbed abroad (b). \nIn other words, exports of value added are a net concept; it has to exclude from the gross exports both foreign value added and the part of domestic value added that is imported back to home.\nIdentifying and estimating these double-counted terms in gross exports have \nimportant implications for measuring each country’s position in global value-chains. For example, two countries can have identical ratios of value-added exports to gross exports but very different ratios of (a) and (b). Those countries that are mainly",

For those applications in which a production-based RCA is the right \nmeasure, we can use GDP in exports to compute RCA.\nWe re-compute the RCA index at the country-sector level for all the countries and \nsectors in our database.

Magnification of Trade Costs from Multi-Stage Production\nAs noted by Yi (2003, 2010), multi-stage production magnifies the effects of trade \ncosts on world trade. There are two separate magnification forces. The first exists because goods that cross national borders multiple times incur tariffs and transpor -\ntation costs multiple times. The second exists because tariffs are applied to gross imports, even though value added by the direct exporter may be only a fraction of this amount. Different ways of participating in global production chains affects the extent to which different countries are affected by such cost magnification. However, Yi (2003) does not actually measure the magnification of tariffs, though it is impor -\ntant to his simulation exercise.\nOur accounting method provides an ideal way to re-examine the magnification",

In online Appendix E, we provide an illustrative calculation of the first order magnification effect of using imported intermediate inputs to produce exports. It r epresents the magnification effect if tariffs were the only factor that augments the \ntrading costs. For instance, we find that one additional stage of production increases \ntrade costs of Vietnam’s merchandise production by 80 percent of its standard tariff. \nGenerally speaking, the magnification effect is stronger for emerging market econo-mies than for developed economies due to the lower domestic value-added share in most developing countries’ manufacturing exports. In the same Appendix, we also show that global ICIO databases constructed by the BEC end-use classification ver -\nsus the proportionality assumption produce different trade cost magnification effects for a number of countries.",

Other Applications\nThe set of examples discussed so far certainly does not exhaust the possible appli-\ncations. For example, the Federal Reserve Board and the IMF routinely compute effective exchange rates using trade weights that are based on gross exports and imports. A conceptually better measure should weight trading partners based on the relative importance in value-added trade rather than in gross trade terms. Our decomposition results make it feasible to do such computations.\nAs another example, for some research or policy questions, one might need to \nlook at the response of a country’s bilateral or multilateral trade to exchange rate changes. Once one recognizes that there is a potential mismatch between trade in value added and trade in gross terms, one would want to take this into account. Our decomposition allows for a correction.",

Conclusions\nWe have developed a unified conceptual framework that can fully account for a \ncountry’s gross exports by its various value-added and double-counted components. This new framework incorporates all previous measures of vertical specialization \nand value-added trade in the literature while adjusting for the back-and-forth trade of \nintermediates across multiple borders. With a full concordance between value-added and double-counted components and official gross trade statistics, it opens the pos-sibility for the System of National Accounts ( SNA) to accept the concept of value-\nadded trade without dramatically changing the current practice of customs trade data collection.
