This is at least six times greater than the equivalent \nnumber for the United States, Japan or any other country, and twice the number for the European Union considered as a \nwhole. This large number of dominant positions held by China is atypical by historical standards, at least since the 1970s. \nWhile we do not identify definite causes of China’s numerous dominant positions, we can rule out some explanations.",

This figure is at least six times greater \nthan the equivalent number for the United States, Japan or \nany other country; even the European Union considered as a \nwhole does not reach half this level. \nThis fact is intriguing, and is potentially consequential. \nIndeed, close economic interdependence, and trade relations \nin particular, are increasingly considered through the lens \nof dependence, thus raising questions of vulnerability and \nleverage.

Relying on \na 50% threshold to characterize \ndominance is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, and we will \ncheck our results’ robustness to using alternative values. \nHowever, arithmetically, having a more-than-half share \nof a market implies that the country is the most important \nprovider, generally by far. Hence, a supplier that enjoys a \ndominant position has more leverage over its buyers, and \nputs competitors at a disadvantage. At the same time, a buyer \nthat relies on imports of a product where one of the exporters \nholds a dominant position is vulnerable to disruptions from a \ndominant source. \nRecent empirical assessments of trade vulnerabilities reflect \nthis view.

Accordingly, \nbuilding on previous work by Bonneau and Nakaa (2020), \nthe first step in the empirical identification of dependencies \nrelies on an indicator of the concentration of EU imports \nfrom extra-EU sources.

However, even taking \nits high market share into account, the number of product-\nlevel dominant positions appears particularly high for China. \nWith an export market share slightly larger than the EU’s \n(18% vs. 17%), it holds twice as many dominant positions; \nthe US’s market share is much smaller, at 11%, but it has \napproximately six times fewer dominant positions.",

Within each good gthere can\nbe many varieties (differentiated by brands, firms, source countries, etc.). Within a good g, consumers\nsubstitute across varieties with elasticity σg. Suppliers have monopoly power of varying degrees over their\nvarieties. When setting their prices suppliers act strategically, and take into account their influence on other\nsuppliers within a good, but ignore the potential influence their actions may have on other goods.\nWe model competition within a good either a la Bertrand (price competition) or a la Cournot (competi-",
