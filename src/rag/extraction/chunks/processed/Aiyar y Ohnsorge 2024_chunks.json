Drawing from a newly constructed database, this column explores the concept of ‘connector’ countries,\nwhich can be vertical along supply chains or horizontal across markets. The authors argue that vertical connectors may increasingly\ncome under political pressure, whereas horizontal connectors may be more resilient to geopolitical shocks. Countries that are more\nopen to global trade and investment and have more efficient financial markets are better horizontal connectors.\nAUTHORS\nShekhar Aiyar\n ;  ; \n ;  \nFranziska Ohnsorge\n \nGeopolitical differences dampen bilateral trade and investment.

Since 2016, international political tensions have grown and global trade and\ninvestment have begun to fragment along geopolitical lines, a phenomenon that has been dubbed ʻgeoeconomic fragmentationʼ (Aiyar et al.\n2023a , Campos et al. 2023) .\nIn principle, a country that relies heavily on economic transactions with countries with diverging geopolitical views is at greater risk of\ngeopolitical disruptions. But risk may also turn to opportunity: a country that interacts with a wide range of partner countries with diverse\ngeopolitical leanings might be more resilient to disruptions from individual partner countries, and might even benefit due to trade or FDI\ndiversion from rival blocs.

(2024) , we use data on voting patterns at the United Nations to measure a countryʼs\ngeopolitical stance. Specifically, we employ the ideal point index calculated by Bailey et al. (2017) . Broadly speaking, over the past decade\ncountriesʼ geopolitical stances have been clustered into two camps: emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) and advanced\neconomies (Figure 1). Most EMDEs have voting patterns similar to China, while most advanced economies have voting patterns somewhere\nbetween the US and China, but closer to the US.\nFigure 1 Distribution of geopolitical stances, 2023\nSource: Bailey et al.

We combine this\nwith bilateral data on trade (primarily from CEPII and the IMFʼs Direction of Trade Statistics), foreign direct investment (FDI, mainly from\nthe IMFʼs Coordinated Direct Investment Survey and the OECD), portfolio liabilities (from the IMFʼs Coordinated Portfolio Investment\nSurvey), and cross-border bank liabilities (from BIS Consolidated Banking Statistics). The resulting database is available at Harvard\nDataverse.\nPrevious papers, based on proprietary databases, have shown that an increase in geopolitical distance between a pair of countries is\nassociated with diminished bilateral transactions (e.g. Aiyar et al. 2023b  for FDI, and Gopinath et al. 2024 for trade).

The effect is strongest for FDI, with more\nmuted effects for capital goods exports, portfolio investment liabilities, and liabilities to BIS-reporting banks.\nGeoeconomic vulnerability and geoeconomic connectedness\nFollowing IMF (2023) , we create an index of geoeconomic vulnerability, GeoV, that is defined as the transaction-weighted average of\ngeopolitical distances. Thus, for example, Mexicoʼs GeoV for exports is calculated by multiplying its IPD vis-vis a given country by the share\nof Mexicoʼs exports to that country, and then summing over countries.  GeoV captures the intuition that the more a country transacts with\ngeopolitically distant countries, the greater its vulnerability to a geopolitical shock.",

While a country may have a low probability of being hit by a geopolitical shock if it only trades\nwith one politically aligned partner, it would be devastated if a shock actually materialises. From this perspective, diversifying transactions\nacross partners drawn from a range of geopolitical preferences could build resilience to shocks.\nWe construct an index of geoeconomic connectedness, GeoC, based on the weighted standard deviation of a countryʼs geopolitical distance\nfrom partner countries.

A countryʼs exports are more geoeconomically connected when tariffs are lower\nand when the country is part of a larger free trade area. Higher-quality logistics – including the ability to track and trace shipments, fewer\ndelays at ports, better trade and transport infrastructure, and more streamlined customs procedures – are also beneficial. And EMDEs with\nmore open capital accounts tend to attract more diversified sources of capital inflows.\nFinancial market development is particularly important for diversified capital inflows.
