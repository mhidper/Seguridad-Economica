All these events triggered a major geopolitical rift, further increasing the\nrisk of a reversal of international economic integration, referred to as “geoeconomic\nfragmentation” (Aiyar et al., 2023).\nIn many advanced countries, policymakers and enterprises took actions to mit-\nigate exposure to critical dependencies, with a focus on strategic sectors and rela-\ntionships with geopolitically vulnerable nations.
