    "text": "Germany as a business location: \nselected aspects of current dependencies \nand medium- term challenges\nThe German economy is under considerable pressure to adapt. Demographic change is weighing \non prospects for growth and intensifying competition for skilled workers. In foreign trade, there \nare significant dependencies on China. A sudden break with China would likely bring about far- \nreaching disruptions to supply chains and production in the short term. In order to reduce \ndependence on imported fossil fuels and to supply low- emission energy at reasonable costs, it \nwill be vital to expand the supply of renewable energy and to lower energy demand by increasing \nefficiency. Digitalisation may provide opportunities that could significantly boost growth. What is \ncrucial here is not only the production of digital goods, but also the diffusion of these products \nin the form of intermediate inputs to other areas.",

Thus far, demographic \nchange has been counteracted by employing immigrants, amongst other measures. German \nenterprises continue to make great use of the opportunities offered by international markets. All \nin all, industry has been able to mitigate the direct energy price shock fairly well due to its good \nprofitability and financing as well as temporary government assistance measures.
