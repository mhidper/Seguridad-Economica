This paper compares the EU’s evolving economic security policies \nwith the strategies of three other prominent global actors–the United States, China \nand Japan–to better understand the Union’s approach and contribute to the debate \nshaping Europe’s economic security agenda. The paper highlights motivations, his-\ntorical developments, institutional structures and policy interventions to compare \nand contrast the different approaches. The paper also illustrates the negative emula-\ntion effect of economic security measures, which increase the risk of a balkanisation \nof global supply chains. The analysis shows that the United States and China have \nmore long-standing traditions of economic statecraft compared to more recent eco-\nnomic security concerns in Japan and the EU.
