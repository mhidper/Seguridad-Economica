INTRODUCTION \n \nThe IMF review of the role of trade (2015) identifies gaps in the current understanding of \ntrade spillovers to the domestic economy: “The  spillovers of trade examined are mostly \nmacroeconomic and on the demand side (…). Suppl y-side shocks and their welfare effects could \nbe studied.” The examination of global trade netw orks helps to fill this gap by explaining how \nlocalized supply shocks can be transmitted to othe r countries through trade and how these shocks \ncan generate additional domestic disturbance for importer countries. Our methodology seeks to \nidentify and measure supply shock spillover potentia l arising from fragility in the trade networks \nof individual goods.",
