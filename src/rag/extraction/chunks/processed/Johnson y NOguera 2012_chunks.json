Introduction\nTrade in intermediate inputs accounts for as much as two thirds of\ninternational trade. By linking production processes across borders,\nthis input trade creates two distinct measurement challenges. First,\nconventional gross trade statistics tally the gross value of goods at\neach border crossing, rather than the net value added between border\ncrossings. This well-known “double-counting ”problem means that",

This well-known “double-counting ”problem means that\nconventional data overstate the domestic (value added) content of\nexports. Second, multi-country production networks imply that inter-\nmediate goods can travel to their ﬁnal destination by an indirect\nroute. For example, if Japanese intermediates are assembled in Chinainto ﬁnal goods exported to the U.S., then Chinese bilateral gross\nexports embody third party (Japanese) content. Together, “double-\ncounting ”and multi-country production chains imply that there is a\nhidden structure of trade in value added underlying gross trade ﬂows.\nIn this paper, we compute and analyze the value added content of\ntrade. To do so, we require a global bilateral input –output table that de-\nscribes how particular sectors in each destination country purchase in-\ntermediates from both home and individual foreign sources, as well as",

We then use value added to output ratios from the source\ncountry to compute the value added associated with the implicit\noutput transfer to each destination.

Second,\nmultilateral ( “triangular ”) production sharing gives rise to indirect\ntrade that occurs via countries that process intermediate goods.\nFor some country pairs, bilateral VAX ratios are larger than one, as\nbilateral value added exports exceeds gross exports.\nThese adjustments imply that bilateral trade imbalances often dif-\nfer in value added and gross terms.
