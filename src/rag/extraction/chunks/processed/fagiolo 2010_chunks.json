We show that most countries are characterized by\nweak trade links; yet, there exists a group of countries featuring a large numberof strong relationships, thus hinting to a core-periphery structure. Also, better-\nconnected countries tend to trade with poorly-connected ones, but are also\ninvolved in highly-interconnected trade clusters. Furthermore, rich countriesdisplay more intense trade links and are more clustered.

Fagiolo et al.\n6 Concluding remarks\nIn this paper, we have explored the empirical properties of the world trade\nweb (WTW) using network analysis. This allows us to better characterize the\ndegree of international trade integration and to track its evolution over time.Following a stream of recent literature, we have conceptualized the web of\ntrade relationships across countries as a weighted network where countries\nplay the role of nodes, and trade ﬂows represents links between nodes. Tothat end, we have studied imports/exports ﬂows between all pairs formed out\nof 159 countries, from 1981 to 2000.\nFrom a methodological point of view, we address a thorough empirical\ninvestigation of the statistical properties of the WTW as a weighted network.\nThis means that instead of accounting for the mere presence of a trade",
