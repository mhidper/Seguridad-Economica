Brexit, the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine all pose a challenge to international relations and could herald a reversal of global economic integration.\nA slowdown in globalization – often referred to as ‘‘slowbalization’’ – is not new and, for most countries, dates to the aftermath of\nthe global financial crisis ( Antràs , 2020 ; Baldwin , 2022 ). Within this slowdown, a fall in foreign direct investment (FDI) has been\nparticularly visible, with global FDI declining from 3.3 percent of GDP in the 2000s to 1.3 percent over the last 5 years, according\nto the IMF World Economic Outlook dataset.

To further understand if recent rising geopolitical tensions are driving the geographical footprint of global FDI,\nwe ask whether the role of geopolitical alignment is more relevant for strategic sectors, and if it has become more salient in recent\nyears.

Recently, the U.S. Treasury Secretary argued that, rather than being highly reliant on countries with which the U.S. has\ngeopolitical frictions, firms should move towards the friend-shoring of supply chains to a large number of trusted countries. In\nEurope, the French government has been urging the EU to accelerate production targets, weaken state aid rules, and develop a\n‘‘Made in Europe’’ strategy to counter domestic production subsidies provided by the recent U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Recent\nlarge-scale policies implemented by major countries to strengthen strategic domestic manufacturing sectors suggest that a shift\nin cross-border capital flows is being incentivized. Most notable is a series of recent bills in the U.S. – such as the CHIPS and Science\nAct and the IRA – and in Europe – such as the European Chips Act – that aim to alter the fundamentals of multinational enterprises’\nproduction and sourcing strategies, thereby inducing a reconfiguration of supply chain networks. The rising interest in friend-shoring\nis a significant reversal of the traditional division of production pursued through offshoring, driven predominantly by international\ncost differentials in labor and input costs (Feenstra, 1998; Antràs and Yeaple, 2014).",

These are some of the hypotheses we\ninvestigate to answer our research questions. To do so, as discussed in Section 2, we combine two main sources of data.

This result in not limited to greenfield FDI, but holds also for brownfield FDI (M&As).\nThe role of geopolitical distance is particularly relevant for investment in strategic sectors and for FDI in low- and middle-income\ncountries, for which results are robust to the inclusion of country-pair fixed effects which can control for all unobservable bilateral",

However, these studies are either based on specific source countries – like the U.S. (Desbordes, 2010) or\nChina (Li et al., 2018) – or on a relatively small set of source and host countries (Desbordes and Vicard, 2009; Bertrand et al.,",

First, a simple measure of FDI geopolitical concentration shows that\nthe likelihood that FDI take place between geopolitically aligned countries is more than twice higher than one would expect if FDI\nwere taking place independent of geopolitical considerations over the almost two decades spanned by our data. Second, we show\nthat in more recent years this likelihood is about 2.5 times higher, suggesting that the relevance of geopolitics for FDI decisions has\nincreased over time.
