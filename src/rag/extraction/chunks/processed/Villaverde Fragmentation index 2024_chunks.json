Events such as Brexit, the invasion of Ukraine, and\nconflicts in the Middle East have strained international relations and prompted policymakers\nto reconsider their nations’ economic strategies. Free trade agreements, once common, have\nbecome rare and the number of trade-restricting measures implemented in 2022 nearly tripled\ncompared to 2019. Consequently, households, firms, and governments are reassessing their\noperations amid growing geopolitical and trade complexities.

However, no single measure of\ngeopolitical fragmentation fully captures the current state of global economic integration, as\neach indicator only addresses one aspect of it.

The main idea behind\na DFM, as pioneered by Sargent and Sims (1977), Geweke (1977), and Stock and Watson\n(1989), is that many observed indicators of a phenomenon (such as the business cycle or, in\nour case, geopolitical fragmentation) are driven by a common unobserved factor. While each\nindicator is inherently imperfect and contaminated by idiosyncratic noise, we can employ\na likelihood-based approach to estimate the unobserved index that captures the underlying\ndynamics of interest.\nThe DFM approach has gained popularity because it is data-driven and minimizes the\nsubjective decisions a researcher needs to make.

First, it allows us to gauge\nthe evolution of geopolitical fragmentation. An increase in the factor indicates that the\nworld economy is becoming more fragmented, thus providing a quantitative confirmation (or\nrefutation) of more casual assessments and mitigating the possible confirmatory bias present\nin many qualitative evaluations by experts. Second, the estimated factor can be used as an\ninput for other empirical analyses, such as a variable in a structural vector autoregression\n(SVAR) or a linear projection (LP) for causality assessment.

This index reveals three distinct phases.\nFirst, there was a period of relative stability in geopolitical fragmentation from 1975 to the\nearly 1990s.
