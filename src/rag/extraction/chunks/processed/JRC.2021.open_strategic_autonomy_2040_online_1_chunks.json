The crisis \nhas underlined that to build a more resilient and ‘fu-\nture-proof’ Europe, the EU should be more aware of \nits critical dependencies. This report describes trends \nand emerging issues, looking forward at how they \ncould evolve over time, and looking at the opportu-\nnities and risks they entail. The process and results \ndepicted in the present science for policy report un-\nderpins the European Commission’s 2021 Strategic \nForesight Report5. \nThe concept of open strategic autonomy has \nemerged in a context of increasing global connectivi-\nty and multidimensional interdependence on the one \nhand, and assertive to aggressive competition on the \nother. Its core features include notions of a future \nstate of enhanced resilience, managed mutual inter-\ndependence and relative power evolving from exist-\ning capacities, vulnerabilities, and dependencies.",

However, the world in 2040 is not something that can be grasped with absolute \ncertainty. These scenarios therefore represent an attempt to construct a number of hypothe-\nses about the future, which can help frame assumptions about the present as much as about \nthe future. By design, each of the four scenarios is at the edge of plausibility.\nScenarios enable us to explore possible futures and their potential implications by \nreframing individual and collective assumptions513. By showing gradations in the EU’s \npossible internal and external contexts in 2040, the scenarios challenge assumptions about \nthe future of the EU. \nIt is important to clarify that foresight scenarios are not predictions of the future,",

Rather, they are coherent simulations of plausible future \nstates of the world that highlight the ways in which trends, weak signals and uncertainties \nfrom the present could develop in the future. In so doing, foresight scenarios reveal the \nchoices available today and their potential consequences for the future. \nIn essence, the future cannot be predicted, although some of the elements of the \nfuture can already be discerned. There will inevitably be a mixture of ‘known unknowns’ \nand ‘unknown unknowns’ – so called ‘black swan’ or wild cards events.
