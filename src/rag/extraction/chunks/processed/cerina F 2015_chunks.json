By keeping track of the inter-industrial relationships, the input-output table offers a reasonably accurate measurement of\nthe response of any given economy in the face of external shocks or policy interventions. As\nthe global economy becomes increasingly integrated, an isolated view based on the nationalinput-output table is no longer sufficient to assess an individual economy ’s strength and weak-\nness, not to mention finding solutions to global challenges such as climate change and financial\ncrises. Hence, a global multi-regional input-output (GMRIO) framework is needed to draw a\nhigh-resolution representation of the global economy [\n2].

First, theWION is based on industries. Not only the cross-country industrial relationships, but also thedomestic ones can be studied.
