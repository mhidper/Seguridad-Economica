In the late 1990s and early 2000s, much attention was drawn to how cross -border production and supply chain arrangements – often referred to as \nglobal  value chains (GVCs) – could improve the efficiency of even the most complex \nmanufacturing processes. Spurred by advances in communication technologies and a liberalizing trade policy environment, firms started to reap the benefits of specialization more extensively by performing production stages or procuring inputs across  a host of locations, each particularly",

In its place, concerns are \nbeing voiced over the wisdom of sprawling supply chains that can expose firms and countries to the risk of disruptions. A confluence of recent events has shown that this risk now present s itself \nin myriad forms. Extreme weather events (associated with climate change) and natural disasters (such as the Tohoku earthquake) have sent shockwaves through global supply chains by \ndisrupting the flow of critical inputs (Barrot  and Sauvagnat 2016;  Boehm et al. 2019). Public \nhealth shocks have emerged as a novel source of risk, epitomized by the shortages of medical \nequipment and other critical necessities at the height of the Covid- 19 pandemic. There is a",

The underlying causes of this backlash are complex and vary somewhat from country to country. But an influential line of research has found one common thread, linking this disaffection to the longstanding decline in manufacturing sector jobs in advanced economies that can be attributed (at least in part) to import competition from China (Autor et al. 2013, 2016;  \nDauth et al. 2014;  Colantone and Stanig 2018).\n1 In countries such as the US, this has contributed \nto a strong under -current of reservation among segments of the general public about engaging \nwith China as a trade and supply chain partner (Alfaro et al. 2023).   \n But sentiment aside, what do the data actually tell us about the state -of-play in global supply",

We have supplemented this with further evidence that the US tariffs have also raised uni t \nimport prices from alternative source locations, principally Vietnam and Mexico. For a more comprehensive understanding, future research should examine the effects on firms’ profitability and productivity as additional data becomes available .  \n Policies in favor of friendshoring, nearshoring or reshoring may nevertheless be justifiable if these generate dynamic gains that offset or exceed the static losses.
