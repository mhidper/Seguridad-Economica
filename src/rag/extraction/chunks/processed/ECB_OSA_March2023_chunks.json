When the analysis \nzooms in on exposed goods with a high Chinese market share, a high concentration on a few source countries or a low trade elasticity (Fontagné et al., 2022), the estimated size of the “friend-\nshoring” coefficient increases on average, albeit with higher statistical uncertai nty and again without \nshowing any clear trend.",

We also demonstrate that a (non- targeted) reorientation of \nglobal supply chains does not improve resilience against global shocks, and substantially reduces \nresilience against domestic shocks. Finally, we show that fiscal policy, the primary macroeconomic \nstabilisation instrument available to small open economies in a customs and/or currency union, can \nplay an important role in mitigating some of the negative side effects of localisation policies.  \nFirst, we examine the implications of euro area exporters permanently reducing their preference for \nimported intermediate inputs and, instead, favouring the use of regionally -produced inputs (i.e. \nreshoring production). Our analysis assumes a partial reshoring, whereby the decrease in \npreferences gradually reduces imported intermediate inputs by 1% of GDP over the long run. This \nrelatively limited reshoring is in line with localisation policies focusing on only the most essential",

We find that  reshoring production does not achieve this goal. The reshored \neconomy has almost the same sensitivity to global shocks (dashed compared to solid blue line, \nChart A, panel c), while it is substantially more exposed to regional shocks (dashed compared to \nsolid red line, Chart A, panel c).
