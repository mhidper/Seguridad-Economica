Bailey1,2, Anton Strezhnev3,\nand Erik Voeten1,4\nAbstract\nUnited Nations (UN) General Assembly votes have become the standard data\nsource for measures of states preferences over foreign policy. Most papers use\ndyadic indicators of voting similarity between states. We propose a dynamic ordinal\nspatial model to estimate state ideal points from 1946 to 2012 on a single dimension\nthat reflects state positions toward the US-led liberal order. We use information\nabout the content of the UN’s agenda to make estimates comparable across time.\nCompared to existing measures, our estimates better separate signal from noise in\nidentifying foreign policy shifts, have greater face validity, allow for better inter-\ntemporal comparisons, are less sensitive to shifts in the UN’ agenda, and are strongly\ncorrelated with measures of liberalism.
