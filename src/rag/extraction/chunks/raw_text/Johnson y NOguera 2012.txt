Input –output tablesWe combine input –output and bilateral trade data to compute the value added content of bilateral trade. The
ratio of value added to gross exports (VAX ratio) is a measure of the intensity of production sharing. Across
countries, export composition drives VAX ratios, with exporters of Manufactures having lower ratios. Acrosssectors, the VAX ratio for Manufactures is low relative to Services, primarily because Services are used as an
intermediate to produce manufacturing exports. Across bilateral partners, VAX ratios vary widely and contain
information on both bilateral and triangular production chains. We document speci ﬁcally that bilateral pro-
duction linkages, not variation in the composition of exports, drive variation in bilateral VAX ratios. Finally,
bilateral imbalances measured in value added differ from gross trade imbalances. Most prominently, the
U.S.–China imbalance in 2004 is 30 –40% smaller when measured in value added.

1. Introduction
Trade in intermediate inputs accounts for as much as two thirds of
international trade. By linking production processes across borders,
this input trade creates two distinct measurement challenges. First,
conventional gross trade statistics tally the gross value of goods at
each border crossing, rather than the net value added between border
crossings. This well-known “double-counting ”problem means that
conventional data overstate the domestic (value added) content of
exports. Second, multi-country production networks imply that inter-
mediate goods can travel to their ﬁnal destination by an indirect
route. For example, if Japanese intermediates are assembled in Chinainto ﬁnal goods exported to the U.S., then Chinese bilateral gross
exports embody third party (Japanese) content. Together, “double-
counting ”and multi-country production chains imply that there is a
hidden structure of trade in value added underlying gross trade ﬂows.
In this paper, we compute and analyze the value added content of
trade. To do so, we require a global bilateral input –output table that de-
scribes how particular sectors in each destination country purchase in-
termediates from both home and individual foreign sources, as well as
how each country sources ﬁnal goods. Because these bilateral ﬁnal and
intermediate goods linkages are not directly observed in standard
trade and national accounts data sources, we construct a synthetic
table by combining input –output tables and bilateral trade data for
many countries. Using this table, we split each country's gross output
according to the destination in which it is ultimately absorbed in ﬁnal
demand. We then use value added to output ratios from the source
country to compute the value added associated with the implicit
output transfer to each destination. The end result is a data set of
“value added exports ”that describes the destination where the value
added produced in each source country is absorbed.
These data on the value added content of trade have many poten-
tial uses. Most directly, we compare them to gross bilateral trade
ﬂows to quantify the scope of production sharing. This approach to
measuring production sharing yields comparable ﬁgures for many
countries and sectors and respects the multilateral structure of
production sharing. Further, because we use the national accounts

models.1This is important because the value added content of trade is
a key theoretical object and calibration target in many trade and mac-
roeconomic models. For example, value added exports can be used to
calibrate “openness ”and bilateral exposure to foreign shocks in inter-
national business cycle research.2For trade research, value added
ﬂows could be used to calibrate gravity-style trade models to allow
for differences in trade patterns for ﬁnal and intermediate goods.3
They could also be employed to calibrate many-country models of
multi-stage production and vertical specialization, as in Yi (2003,
2010) . And these applications only scratch the surface.
Our approach to measuring the value added content of trade draws
on an older literature on input –output accounting with multiple re-
gions. Our method of tracking the ﬂow of intermediate inputs across
borders was initially developed by Treﬂer and Zhu (2010) ,w h oi n
turn built on the older multi-regional input –output literature.4Treﬂer
and Zhu use their procedure to track the movement of each intermedi-
ate input across each border and then use this information to calculate
the factor content of trade i.e., the amount of primary factors such as
labor that are embodied in the trade of intermediate and ﬁnal goods.
In contrast, we use their tracking procedure as a ﬁrst stage in calculating
the value added content of trade i.e., the value of primary factors that
are embodied in the trade of intermediate and ﬁnal goods.5
Our work is also related to an active literature on measuring vertical
specialization and the domestic content of exports.6Aggregating across
sectors and export destinations for each source country, the ratio of
value added to gross exports can be interpreted as a metric of the do-
mestic content of exports.7Our domestic content metric generalizes
the work by Hummels et al. (2001) . Hummels et al. compute the
value added content of exports under the restrictive assumption that
a country's exports (whether composed of ﬁnal versus intermediate
goods) are entirely absorbed in ﬁnal demand abroad. That is, it rules
out scenarios in which a country exports intermediates that are used
to produce ﬁnal goods absorbed at home. By using input –output data
for source and destination countries simultaneously, we are able to
relax this assumption. While this generalization results in only minor
adjustments in aggregate domestic content measurements in our data,
we demonstrate that relaxing this assumption is critically important
for generating accurate bilateral value added ﬂows.
Turning to our empirical results, we ﬁnd that the ratio of value
added to gross exports (VAX ratio) varies substantially across coun-tries and sectors. Across sectors, we show that VAX ratios are substan-
tially higher in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Services than in
Manufactures. This is mostly due to the fact that the manufacturing
sector purchases inputs from non-manufacturing sectors, and there-
fore contains value added generated in those sectors. Across countries,
the composition of trade drives aggregate VAX ratios, with countries
that export Manufactures having lower aggregate VAX ratios. Aggre-
gate VAX ratios do not covary strongly with income per capita, howev-
er, due to two offsetting effects. While richer countries tend to export
Manufactures, which lowers their aggregate VAX ratios, they also
export at higher VAX ratios within the manufacturing sector.
8Moving from aggregate to bilateral data, VAX ratios differ widely
across partners for individual countries. For example, U.S. exports to
Canada are about 40% smaller measured in value added terms than
gross terms, whereas U.S. exports to France are essentially identical in
gross and value added terms. These gaps arise for two main
reasons. First, bilateral ( “back-and-forth ”) production sharing implies
that value added trade is scaled down relative to gross trade. Andthese scaling factors differ greatly across bilateral partners. Second,
multilateral ( “triangular ”) production sharing gives rise to indirect
trade that occurs via countries that process intermediate goods.
For some country pairs, bilateral VAX ratios are larger than one, as
bilateral value added exports exceeds gross exports.
These adjustments imply that bilateral trade imbalances often dif-
fer in value added and gross terms. For example, the U.S. –China
deﬁcit is approximately 30 –40% smaller when measured on a value
added basis, while the U.S. –Japan de ﬁcit is approximately 33% larger.
These adjustments point to the importance of triangular production
chains within Asia.
To illustrate the mechanisms at work in generating these results, we
present two decompositions. In the ﬁrst decomposition, we show that
most of the variation in bilateral value added to export ratios arises
due to production sharing, not variation in the composition of goods
exported to different destinations. The second decomposition splits bi-
lateral exports according to whether they are absorbed in the destina-
tion, embedded as intermediates in goods that are re ﬂected back to
the source country, or redirected to third countries embedded as inter-
mediates in goods ultimately consumed there. Variation in the degree of
absorption, re ﬂection, and redirection across partners is an important
driver of variation in bilateral value added to export ratios.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the
general accounting framework, de ﬁnes our value added trade mea-
sures, and discusses the interpretation of value added to export ratios.
Section 3 describes the data sources and assumptions we use to imple-
ment the accounting exercise. Section 4 presents our empirical results
andSection 5 concludes.
2. The value added content of trade
In this section, we introduce the accounting framework and demon-
strate how intermediate goods trade generates differences between
gross and value added trade ﬂows. We begin the section by presenting
a general formulation of the framework with many goods and countries
that we use in the calculations below. To aid intuition, we then exposit
several results in stripped-down versions of this general framework.
Results from these simple models carry over to the general model. We
close by discussing the relationship between our framework and two
related lines of work on regional input –output linkages and measure-
ment of the factor content of trade.
2.1. The value added content of trade
Assume there are Ssectors and Ncountries. Each country produces
a single differentiated tradable good within each sector, and we
deﬁne the quantity of output produced in sector sof country ito be
q
i(s). This good is produced by combining local factor inputs with
domestic and imported intermediate goods. It is then either used to
satisfy ﬁnal demand (equivalently, “consumed ”) or used as an inter-
mediate input in production.
The key feature of the global input –output framework is that it
tracks bilateral shipments of this output for ﬁnal and intermediate
use separately. Tracking these ﬂows requires four dimensional nota-
tion denoting source and destination country, as well as source and
destination sectors for shipments of intermediates. Let the quantity
ofﬁnal goods from sector sin country iabsorbed in destination jbe
qijc(s) and the quantity of intermediates from sector sin country i
used to produce output in sector tin country jbeqijm(s,t).1This contrasts with alternative approaches, such as using data on trade in parts and
components (e.g., Yeats (2001) ) or trade between multinational parents and af ﬁliates
(e.g., Hanson et al. (2005) ).

with and without intermediate goods.

develop value added trade computations along the lines of those used in this paper.See also Powers, Wang, and Wei (2009) on splitting up the value chain within Asia.

et al. (2008) for China. See Hummels et al. (2001) and Miroudot et al. (2009) for changes
in domestic content over time for mainly OECD countries.
7Bilateral or sector level ratios of value added to exports do not have this domestic
content interpretation.
8VAX ratios within Manufactures are correlated with income because richer coun-
tries tend to export in sub-sectors with relatively high VAX ratios.225 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
The global input –output framework organizes these ﬂows
via market clearing conditions. Markets clear in quantities: qi(s)=
∑ jqijc(s)+∑ j∑ tqijm(s,t). If we evaluate these quantity ﬂows at a
common price, say pi(s), then we can rewrite the market clearing
condition in value terms as:
yisðÞ¼∑jcijsðÞ þ∑j∑tmijs;tðÞ ; ð1Þ
where yi(s)≡pi(s)qi(s),cij(s)≡pi(s)qijc(s), and mij(s,t)≡pi(s)qijm(s,t) are
the value of production, ﬁnal demand, and intermediate goods ship-
ments. Gross bilateral exports, denoted xij(s), include goods destined
for both ﬁnal and intermediate use abroad: xij(s)=cij(s)
+∑ tmij(s,t). Then Eq. (1)equivalently says that output is divided
between domestic ﬁnal use, domestic intermediate use, and gross
exports.
To express market clearing conditions for many countries and sec-
tors in a compact form, we de ﬁne a series of matrices and vectors.
Collect the total value of production in each sector in the S×1 vector
yiand allocate this output to ﬁnal and intermediate use. Denote coun-
try i's ﬁnal demand for its own goods by S×1 vector ciiand shipments
ofﬁnal goods from ito country jby the S×1 vector cij. Further, denote
use of intermediate inputs from iby country jbyAijyj, where Aijis
anS×Sinput –output matrix with elements Aij(s,t)=mij(s,t)/yj(t). A
typical element describes, for example, the value of steel (s = steel)
imported by Canada ( j= Canada) from the U.S. ( i= U.S.) used in
the production of automobiles ( t= autos) as a share of total output
of autos in Canada. Gross exports from itoj(i≠j) are then xij=cij+
Aijyj.
With this notation in hand, we collect information on inter-
mediate goods sourcing and ﬁnal goods ﬂows in vector/matrix
form:

Then, we write the S×Ngoods market clearing conditions as:
y¼Ayþ∑jcj: ð2Þ
This is the classic representation of an input –output system,
where total output is split between intermediate and ﬁnal use.
Whereas a typical input –output system focuses on sectoral linkages
within a single economy, this system is expanded to trace intermedi-
ate goods linkages across countries and sectors. We therefore refer to
Aas the global bilateral input –output matrix.
Using this system, we can write output as:
y¼∑jI−AðÞ−1cj: ð3Þ
To interpret this expression, ( I−A)−1is the “Leontief inverse ”of
the input –output matrix. The Leontief inverse can be expressed
as a geometric series: ( I−A)−1=∑ k=0∞Ak. Multiplying by the
ﬁnal demand vector, the zero-order term cjis the direct output
absorbed as ﬁnal goods, the ﬁrst-order term [ I+A]cjis the direct
output absorbed plus the intermediates used to produce that output,
the second-order term [ I+A+A2]cjincludes the additional interme-
diates used to produce the ﬁrst round of intermediates ( Acj), and
the sequence continues as such. Therefore, ( I−A)−1cjis the
vector of output used both directly and indirectly to produce ﬁnal
goods absorbed in country j.Eq.(3)thus decomposes output from each source country iinto
the amount of output from the source used to produce ﬁnal goods
absorbed in country j. To make this explicit, we de ﬁne:

BB@1
CCA≡I−AðÞ−1cj; ð4Þ
where yijis the S×1 vector of output from iused to produce ﬁnal
goods absorbed in j.
These output transfers are conceptually distinct from gross
exports. Gross exports xij(s) are directly observed as a bilateral ship-
ment from sector sin country ito country j. In contrast, bilateral out-
put transfers are not directly observed, but rather constructed using
information on the global input requirements for ﬁnal goods
absorbed in each country. Importantly, as inputs from a particular
country and sector travel through the production chain, they may
be embodied in ﬁnal goods of any sector or country. For example,
inputs exported from country ito country jmay be embedded in
country jﬁnal goods that are absorbed in a third country k, or inputs
produced by sector smay be embodied in ﬁnal goods from sector t.
These possibilities give rise to important differences in the structure
of bilateral output transfers versus bilateral trade.
Our system of Eqs. (1)–(4)tracks the ﬂow of each intermediate
input across each border. These equations and the resulting tracking
method are identical to what appears in Treﬂer and Zhu (2010) . Hav-
ing developed the method, they then applied it to calculating the
factor content of trade. We explain this application in Section 2.2.4 .
Our interest here is different: we wish to calculate the value added
content of international trade.
To calculate the value added associated with these implicit output
transfers, de ﬁne the ratio of value added to output for each sector
within country i,a s ri(t)=1−∑ j∑ sAji(s,t). This value added
ratio, expressed here as one minus the share of domestic plus
imported intermediates in total output, is equal to payments to
domestic factors as a share of gross output. Put differently, this is
ratio of GDP to gross output at the sector level.
With this notation in hand, we can now de ﬁne value added ex-
ports and the value added to export ratio, “VAX ratio ”, as a measure
of the value added content of trade.
Deﬁnition 1 . Value added exports
The total value added produced in sector sin source country iand
absorbed in destination country jisvaij(s)=ri(s)yij(s). Total value
added produced in iand absorbed in jis then vaij=∑ svaij(s).
Deﬁnition 2 . VAX ratio
The sector-level bilateral value added to export ratio is given by
vaij(s)/xij(s). The aggregate bilateral value added to export ratio is
vaij/ιxij, where ιis a 1× Svector of ones.
2.2. Discussion
We turn to special cases to interpret value added trade ﬂows and
the value added content of trade. We use a two country model to de-
velop intuition for the value added content of trade calculations and
link our analysis to previous work on the domestic content of exports
(equivalently, vertical specialization) by Hummels et al. (2001) .W e
then use a stylized three country model to demonstrate how the
framework tracks value added through the multi-country production
chain, even if that value added travels to its ﬁnal destination via third
countries. We also discuss the interpretation of VAX ratios in multi-
sector models. We conclude by setting our framework in context of226 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
related literature on regional input –output linkages and the measure-
ment of the factor content of trade.
2.2.1. Two countries, one sector per country
Suppose that there are now only two countries, and each country
produces a single differentiated aggregate good. Then the analog to
the output decomposition (3)is:
y1
y2/C18/C19
¼I−α11α12
α21α22/C18/C19/C20/C21−1c11
c21/C18/C19
þI−α11α12
α21α22/C18/C19/C20/C21−1c12
c22/C18/C19
: ð5Þ
This system describes how the gross output of each country is em-
bodied in ﬁnal consumption in each of the two countries. To unpack
this result, we solve for the breakdown of country 1's production:
y1¼y11þy12
with y11¼M1c11þα12
1−α22c21/C18/C19
and y12¼M1α12
1−α22c22þc12/C18/C19
;ð6Þ
where M1≡1−α11−α12α21
1−α22/C16/C17−1≥1 is an intermediate goods multiplier
that describes the total amount of gross output from country 1
required to produce one unit of country 1's net output.9
Theﬁrst term ( y11) is the total amount of country 1's output that is
required to produce ﬁnal goods absorbed in country 1. This term in-
cludes both output dedicated to satisfy country 1's demand for its
own ﬁnal goods ( M1c11), as well as output needed to satisfy country
1's demand for country 2 ﬁnal goods M1α12
1−α22c21/C16/C17
.10The second
term ( y12) has a similar interpretation in terms of country 2's de-
mand.11Because Eq. (6)geographically decomposes country 1's
output, we can translate this into a decomposition of value added:
va1=va11+va12, where vaij=[1−α11−α21]yijis value added gen-
erated by country ithat is absorbed in country j.
There are four output concepts underlying ﬂows from country 1
to country 2: (1) ﬁnal goods c12, (2) gross exports x12, (3) implicit
output transfers y12, and (4) value added exports va12. We pause
here to clarify the relationship between them. To begin, note that
x12=c12+α12y2,s oc12≤x12when there are exported intermediates.
Further, using the output decomposition for country 2 ( y2=y22+
y21), we decompose gross exports as: x12=α12y21+(c12+α12y22).
Multiplying both sides of the expression by (1 −α11)−1then trans-
lates exports into the gross output required to produce them.12It is
straightforward to show that y12=(1−α11)−1(c12+α12y22). There-
fore, y12=(1−α11)−1x12−(1−α11)−1α12y21. So the implicit output
transferred from country 1 to country 2 is equal to the gross output
required to produce exports minus the gross output that is re ﬂected
back embedded in country 2 goods that are absorbed by country1.13Finally, we note that va12≤y12, because the value added to out-
put ratio is bounded above by one.
To directly compare value added exports to gross exports, we
compute the VAX ratio:
va12
x12¼1−α11−α21 ðÞ y12
x12
¼1−α11−α21
1−α11x12−α12y21
x12/C18/C19
;ð7Þ
where the second line follows from the discussion in the previous
paragraph. The difference x12−α12y21is exports less re ﬂected inter-
mediates, or equivalently the portion of exports genuinely consumed
abroad. The VAX ratio will always be less than one, so value added
exports are scaled down relative to gross exports.
The VAX ratio for a country can be thought of as a metric of the
“domestic content of exports. ”Indeed, it is closely related to previ-
ous approaches to measuring domestic content in the literature.
To see this, note that the VAX ratio has two components. The ﬁrst
component,1−α11−α21
1−α11, is equivalent to a metric of domestic content
developed in Hummels et al. (2001) .14This metric captures the
value added associated with the gross output needed to produce
exports as a fraction of total exports. The Hummels –Ishii –Yi metric
is equal to the VAX ratio only when country 2 does not use imported
intermediates ( α12=0), and therefore country 1 exports ﬁnal goods
alone.15In contrast, with two-way trade in intermediates the
Hummels –Ishii –Yi metric overstates the amount of domestic value
added that is generated per unit of exports.16The second component
of the VAX ratio allows some exports to be dedicated to producing
goods that are ultimately consumed at home. That is, it allows for
a portion of exports to be re ﬂected back to the source rather than
absorbed abroad.
2.2.2. Three countries, one sector per country
While the two country framework illustrates the basic discrepan-
cy between value added and gross trade ﬂows, additional insights
emerge as one introduces a third country to the mix. We focus on a
special, algebraically straightforward case that illustrates how the
accounting framework tracks the ﬁnal destination at which value
added by a given country is consumed even if this value circulates
through a multi-country production chain en route to its ﬁnal desti-
nation. We construct the special case to approximate a stylizedaccount of production chains between the U.S. and Asia.
17
Let country 1 be the U.S., country 2 be China, and country 3 be Japan.
Further, assume that China imports intermediates from the U.S. and
Japan and exports only ﬁnal consumption goods only to the U.S. For sim-
plicity, we assume that the U.S. and Japan do not export any ﬁnal goods
9This multiplier is greater than one because output is “used up ”in the production pro-
cess. Without exported intermediates ( α12=0), this multiplier would be (1 −α11)−1.T h e
additional term re ﬂects the fact that intermediate goods sourced from country 2 contain
output produced by country 1.
10To export ﬁnal goods c21requires producing (1 −α22)−1c21units of country 2 out-
put, which itself requires α12(1−α22)−1c21units of country 1's output as intermedi-
ates. To produce this country 1 output requires M1times α12(1−α22)−1c21units of
country 1's output overall, because some output is used up in the production process.
11To highlight how the output decomposition depends on cross-border intermediate
linkages, note that if α12=0 the output decomposition would be: y11=(1−α11)−1c11
and y12=(1−α11)−1c12. In this counter-factual case, output of country 1 is only used
to produce ﬁnal goods originating in country 1.
12This follows from manipulation of the market clearing condition for country 1:
y1=(1−α11)−1(c11+x12).13Note that if α12=0, then y12=(1−α11)−1x12, so the gross output required to pro-
duce exports equals the actual amount of output transferred from country 1 to country2.
14Hummels et al. focus their discussion on measuring vertical specialization or the
“import content of exports, ”which is given by α21(1−α11)−1. Domestic content is
then one minus the import content of exports. Though we discuss these concepts here
in a scalar case, they generalize in a straightforward way to models with many sectors.
15The condition α12=0 is necessary and suf ﬁcient for equality between the two met-
rics when there is one aggregate sector, except in pathological cases. With more thanone sector, restricting country 1 to export only ﬁnal goods ( α
12(s,t)=0∀s,t) is suf ﬁ-
cient, but not necessary.
16Footnote 18 in Treﬂer and Zhu (2010) provides a related discussion of how the factor
content of trade differs depending on whether one assumes intermediates are traded ornot.
17This example was inspired by Linden et al. (2007) , who trace the iPod production
chain. The iPod combines U.S. intellectual property from Apple with a Japanese displayand disk drive, which is manufactured in China. These components are assembled inChina and the iPod is shipped to the U.S.227 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
and only export intermediates to China. This con ﬁguration of production
can be represented as:

This system provides the implicit output transfers needed to cal-
culate value added ﬂows.
Two points are interesting to note. First, as in the two-country case
above, U.S. demand for U.S. output has both a direct component
1
1−α11 ðÞc11, and an indirect componentα12
1−α11 ðÞ 1−α22 ðÞc21that accounts
for the fact that U.S. imports of ﬁnal goods from China include embed-
ded U.S. content. Thus, a larger share of U.S. output is ultimately
absorbed at home than bilateral trade statistics would indicate. Corre-
spondingly, Chinese bilateral exports overstate the true Chinese con-
tent shipped to the U.S. due to bilateral U.S. –China production
sharing.
The second point is that, although Japan does not export directly
to the U.S., the U.S. does import Japanese content embedded in Chi-
nese exports to the U.S. This effect is the result of multi-country pro-
duction chains, and was absent in the two country case analyzed
above. In the equation for Japan (country 3), this effect appears as
α32
1−α33 ðÞ 1−α22 ðÞc21.
Because Chinese exports to the U.S. contain both U.S. and Japanese
content, the bilateral VAX ratio of China –U.S. trade is:
va21
x21¼1−va31þα12y21
x21/C18/C19
b1: ð10Þ
This illustrates that the bilateral VAX ratio removes both the Japa-
nese value added ( va31) and U.S. intermediate goods ( α12y21) from
Chinese exports to the U.S.18Turning to Japan, it has positive value
added exports to the U.S. and zero direct bilateral exports. Therefore,
the bilateral VAX ratio for Japan –U.S. trade is unde ﬁned, or practically
inﬁnite for small bilateral exports. This extreme ratio illustrates an-
other general lesson. Though the aggregate VAX ratio is bounded by
one for each country, bilateral VAX ratios may be greater than one
when an exporter sends intermediates abroad to be processed and
delivered to a third country. Thus, bilateral VAX ratios pick up the
inﬂuence of both bilateral and multilateral production sharing
relationships.
When bilateral VAX ratios vary across partners, bilateral value
added balances do not equal bilateral trade imbalances. To illustrate
this, we de ﬁnetb12≡x12−x21andυab12≡υa12−υa21to be bilateralU.S.–China trade and value added balances. In this special case,
where the con ﬁguration of production is given by Eq. (8), these bal-
ances are related as follows:
tb12þα32y21¼υab12: ð11Þ
That is, tb12bυab12. So assuming the U.S. runs a trade de ﬁcit with
China in this example, then it will run a smaller de ﬁcit with China in
value added terms due to the fact that Chinese bilateral trade contains
Japanese content ( α32y21). As a corollary, the U.S.'s bilateral balance
with Japan will be distorted in the opposite direction.
To generalize this result, we can write any given bilateral value
added balance as:
υabij¼υaij
xijxij−υaji
xjixji
¼1
2xijþxji/C16/C17υaij
xij−υaji
xji"#
þ1
2υaij
xijþυaji
xji !
xij−xjihi
:ð12Þ
Theﬁrst term adjusts the value added balance due to differences
in VAX ratios between exports and imports. When the VAX ratio for
exports is high relative to imports, the value added balance is natu-
rally pushed in a positive direction. Note here that this is true even
if gross trade is balanced. The second term adjusts the value added
balance based on the average level of VAX ratios. Starting from an
initial imbalance, the value added balance is scaled up or down rel-
ative to the trade balance, depending on whether VAX ratios are
greater than or less than one (on average). So differences in VAX ra-
tios between partners within a bilateral relationship and the abso-
lute level of the VAX ratios between partners both in ﬂuence the
size of the adjustment in converting gross imbalances to value
added terms.
2.2.3. Two countries, many sectors
The interpretation of aggregate value added exports and VAX ra-
tios developed in the one-sector examples in previous sections carries
over to the many country, multi-sector framework. One importantdistinction between the one-sector and multi-sector frameworks
is that VAX ratio at the sector level cannot be interpreted as the do-
mestic content of exports. To explain its interpretation, we turn to
an example with two countries and many sectors.
19
With two countries ( i,j={1,2}) and many sectors, the VAX ratio
for sector sin country 1 can be written as:va12sðÞ
x12sðÞ¼r1sðÞy12sðÞ
x12sðÞ. Then the
sectoral VAX ratio depends on the value added to output ratio within
a given sector ( r1(s)) and the ratio of gross output produced in a sector
that is absorbed abroad ( y12(s)) to gross exports from that sector
(x12(s)). The role of the value added to output ratio is straightforward:
all else equal, sectors with low value added to output ratios (e.g.,
manufacturing) will have low VAX ratios relative to other sectors.
The role of differences in y12(s) versus x12(s) across sectors is more
subtle. To sort this out, we note that we can link y12and the export
vector x12as in Section 2.2.1 . Speci ﬁcally, x12=(I−A11)y12+A12y21.
Rearranging this expression yields: y12=(I−A11)−1[x12−A12y21].
This is the many sector, matrix analog to computations embedded in
Eq.(7), wherein y12is the gross output needed to produce exports
less re ﬂected intermediates. This decomposition points to two ways
iny12could differ from x12.
18U.S. imports from China contain U.S. content because the U.S. exports intermedi-
ates to China and imports ﬁnal goods from China. Thus, U.S. intermediates are re ﬂected
back to the US and constitute a portion of the value added that the U.S. purchases fromitself.19The many country version of the framework can always be collapsed to an equiv-
alent two country framework, in which input –output linkages among countries in
the rest of the world are subsumed into the “domestic ”input –output structure of the
rest-of-the-world composite.228 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
First, suppose that A12y21is a vector of zeros, so that exports
are 100% absorbed abroad.20This implies: y12=(I−A11)−1x12. All
that remains here separating exports and gross output for individual
sectors is the domestic input –output structure. Generically,
y12(s)≠x12(s), so variation in this ratio across sectors in ﬂuences
sector-level value added.
One important implication of this is that the sectoral VAX ratio
captures information on how individual sectors engage in trade. For
example, consider a situation in which producers in one sector sell
intermediates to purchasers in another sector, who in turn produce
goods for export.21In this case, the intermediate goods suppliers en-
gage in trade indirectly. Hence, we observe no direct exports from the
intermediate goods supplier, but do observe value added exports
because value added from that sector is embedded in the purchaser's
goods. Thus, value added exports from a particular sector may be
physically embodied in goods exported from that sector or embodied
in exports of other sectors. High ratios of value added exports to gross
trade (possibly above one) at the sector level are evidence of indirect
participation in trade. Low ratios instead indicate that a given sector's
gross exports embody value added produced outside that sector.
Second, suppose now that A12is not composed of zeros, but rather
that country 1 exports intermediates to country that are used to pro-
duce goods that are absorbed in country 1, captured by the term
A12y21>0. In this case, the sectoral VAX ratio is in ﬂuenced by how in-
dividual sectors ﬁt into cross-border production chains. For example,
if we shut down all domestic input –output linkages, setting A11to
zero, then y12=x12−A12y21. Then the sectoral VAX ratio depends
on the sector's connection to foreign production chains. Speci ﬁcally,
the VAX ratio will be depend on what share of output is absorbed
abroad versus used to produce foreign goods that are ultimately
absorbed at home. If exports are largely absorbed abroad (i.e.,
y12(s)/x12(s)≈1), one would see a relatively high VAX ratio.
Though these in ﬂuences are dif ﬁcult to separate empirically in
general cases, we discuss evidence below that sheds light on the
relative importance of these channels.
2.2.4. Regional input –output models and the factor content of trade
The framework above is intimately related to two strands of liter-
ature in regional science and trade.
First, we draw on an extensive literature on regional input –output
models. These models, outlined in seminal work by Isard (1951),
Moses (1955), Moses (1960), and Miller (1966) , provide frameworks
for analyzing linkages across regions within countries that can be ex-
tended across borders (as above). Among this literature, Moses
(1955) is the closest antecedent, as he uses proportionality assump-
tions to allocate inputs purchased from other regions, as we do, to
build a multi-region model of the U.S.22One shortcoming of this
line of work is that it typically assumes that the regional system is
‘open ’vis-à-vis the rest-of-the-world, in the sense that shipments
to regions not included in the model are entirely absorbed there.
This assumption is a multi-region analog of the assumptions under
which the Hummels et al. (2001) domestic content calculation is
equal to the value added content of trade.23Second, the value added framework above shares a common
structure with a recent parallel literature on measuring the factor
content of trade. Reimer (2006) and Tre ﬂer and Zhu (2010) both out-
line procedures to compute the net factor content of trade when in-
puts are traded, and use these factor content measures to study the
Vanek prediction. To draw out the similarities, note that one can
think of computing both factor contents and value added contentsusing a two step procedure. First, one needs to compute the output
transfers, speci ﬁed above, that indicate how much output from each
source country and sector are absorbed in ﬁnal demand in a given
destination. Second, one needs to use source country information on
either factor contents (e.g., quantities of factors used to produce one
dollar of output) or value added to output ratios to compute the
factors or value added that is implicitly being traded.
24
Despite this similarity in the underlying structure of value added
and factor content calculations, we emphasize that there are impor-
tant conceptual differences between factor contents and value
added. For one, the theoretical driving forces of trade in value added
may be very different than trade in factors. Costinot et al. (2011)
point out that differences in absolute endowments across countries
inﬂuence where countries are located in the value chain, so absolute
(as opposed to relative) factor endowments are a source of compara-
tive advantage underlying trade in value added.25This is just one
example of a general point: the empirical shift from factor content
to value added content embodies a deeper conceptual shift in how
we think about trade.
3. Data
Our data source is the GTAP 7.1 Data Base assembled by the Global
Trade Analysis Project at Purdue University. This data is compiled
based on three main sources: (1) World Bank and IMF macroeconom-
ic and Balance of Payments statistics; (2) United Nations Commodity
Trade Statistics (Comtrade) Database; and (3) input –output tables
based on national statistical sources. To reconcile data from these dif-
ferent sources, GTAP researchers adjust the input –output tables to be
consistent with international data sources.26The GTAP data includes
bilateral trade statistics and input –output tables for 94 countries
plus 19 composite regions covering 57 sectors in 2004.27Regarding
sector de ﬁnitions, there are 18 Agriculture and Natural Resources sec-
tors, 24 Manufactures sectors, and 15 Services sectors.
20IfA12is matrix of zeros, so that country 1 exports only ﬁnal goods, this obviously
holds. This can also hold for cases in which elements of A12are positive, so long as
the corresponding elements y21are zero. For example, country 1 could export interme-
diates to country 2, so long as the sector purchasing those intermediates only producesoutput for consumption in country 2.
21For example, the “raw milk ”sector in our data has near zero exports, but raw milk is
sold to the “dairy products ”sector, which does export. With two sectors, where 1 is the
dairy products and 2 is the milk sector, this could be represented as an A11matrix with
one non-zero element α11(2,1) and export vector with x12(1)>0 and x12(2)=0. This
structure implies y12(1)/x12(1)=1 and y12(2)/x12(2)= ∞
22Isard (1951) suggests this technique as well, but does not pursue an empirical
application himself.
23Powers, Wang, and Wei (2009) work with a model of this type for Asia.24Let us trace out the calculation explicitly. Tre ﬂer and Zhu de ﬁneTito be a ( NS×1)
vector of trade ﬂows arranged as follows: Ti=[⋯,−xi−1,i',xi',−xi'+1 , i,⋯]′, where xi¼
∑j≠ixijis a ( S×1) vector of total exports from country ito the rest of the world and
xj,iis a ( S×1) vector of bilateral trade ﬂows from j≠itoi. Further, they de ﬁneBto
be a F×SNmatrix of factor requirements for each good: B≡[B1,⋯,Bi,⋯,BN], where Biis
theF×Smatrix of factor requirements for country i, with Fdenoting the number of fac-
tors. The factor content of trade for country iis then: B(I−A)−1Ti. To link this to our
framework, we note that the calculation ( I−A)−1Tireturns a vector of (signed) output
transfers. In particular, ( I−A)−1Ti=[⋯,−yi'
−1,i,yxi',−yi'
+1 , i,⋯]′, where yxi≡∑ j≠iyijis
total output produced in country ithat is absorbed abroad and yj,iis output produced
in country j≠ithat is absorbed in country i. Thus, as suggested above, one can think of
ﬁrst of computing output transfers embedded in trade ﬂows, and then computing the
factor requirements needed to produce those output transfers. See Johnson (2008) for
an extended discussion of these calculations.
25Like absolute endowments, absolute productivity differences are also a source of
comparative advantage in the Costinot, Vogel, and Wang model.
26See the GTAP website at http://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/ for documentation
of the source data. Since raw input –output tables are based on national statistical
sources, they inherit all the shortcomings of those sources. For example, import tablesare often constructed using a “proportionality ”assumption whereby the imported in-
put table is assumed to be proportional to the overall aggregate input –output table.
27GTAP assigns composite regions “representative ”input –output tables, constructed
from input –output tables of similar countries. Composite regions do not play an impor-
tant role in our results, accounting for 5% of world trade and 3% of world value added.
To measure bilateral services trade, GTAP uses OECD data where available and imputes
bilateral services trade elsewhere. Because services account for less than 18% of exportsfor the median country, our results are likely to be insensitive to moderate mismea-surement of services trade.229 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
In the data, we have information on 6 objects for each country:
1.yiis a 57×1 vector of total gross production.
2.cDiis a 57×1 vector of domestic ﬁnal demand.
3.cIiis a 57×1 vector of domestic ﬁnal import demand.
4.Aiiis a 57×57 domestic input –output matrix, with elements Aii(s,t).
5.AIiis a 57×57 import input –output matrix, with elements
AIis;tðÞ ¼ ∑j≠iAjis;tðÞ.
6. {xij} is a collection of 57×1 bilateral export vectors for exports
from itoj.
The de ﬁnition of “ﬁnal demand ”is based on the national accounts,
including consumption, investment, and government purchases. We
value each country's output at a single set of prices, regardless of
where that output is shipped or how it is used. This ensures that the
value of production revenue equals expenditure.28Following input –
output conventions, we use “basic prices, ”deﬁned as price received
by a producer (minus tax payable or plus subsidy receivable by the
producer).29
Note that we do not directly observe the bilateral input –output
matrices Ajiandﬁnal demand vectors cjithat are needed to assemble
the global input –output matrix. Rather, we need to allocate total
imported intermediate use AIiand imported ﬁnal demand cIito indi-
vidual country sources. To do so, we use bilateral trade data and a
proportionality assumption. Speci ﬁcally, we assume that within
each sector imports from each source country are split between
ﬁnal and intermediate in proportion to the overall split of imports be-
tween ﬁnal and intermediate use in the destination. Further, condi-
tional on being allocated to intermediate use, we assume that
imported intermediates from each source are split across purchasing
sectors in proportion to overall imported intermediate use in the
destination.
Formally, for goods from sector sused by sector t,w ed e ﬁne bilat-
eral input –output matrices and consumption import vectors:
Ajis;tðÞ ¼ AIis;tðÞxjisðÞ
∑
jxjisðÞ0
B@1
CAand cjisðÞ¼ cIisðÞxjisðÞ
∑
jxjisðÞ0
B@1
CA:
These assumptions imply that all variation in total bilateral inter-
mediate and ﬁnal goods ﬂows arises due to variation in the composi-
tion of imports across partners. For example, we would ﬁnd that US
imports from Canada are intermediate goods intensive because
most imports from Canada are goods that are on average used as in-
termediates (e.g., auto parts).
The proportionality assumptions above are the standard approach
to dealing with the fact that data on Ajiand cjiare not collected in
national accounts.30Initially adopted in early work on regional
input –output accounts by Moses (1955) , they have also been used
byBelke and Wang (2006), Daudin et al. (forthcoming), and Tre ﬂer
and Zhu (2010) to construct global input –output tables as in thispaper. Several recent papers have explored the consequences of
relaxing some proportionality assumptions using alternative data
sources, and appear to ﬁnd that relaxing these assumptions has
small effects on aggregate VAX ratios or factor contents.31
In the main calculation, we also assume that production tech-
niques and input requirements are the same for exports and domes-
tically absorbed ﬁnal goods. This assumption is problematic for
countries that have large export processing sectors. These processing
sectors (almost by de ﬁnition) produce distinct goods for foreign mar-
kets with different input requirements and lower value added to out-
put ratios than the rest of the economy. Ignoring this fact tends to
overstate the value added content of exports.
As an alternative calculation, we relax this assumption for China
and Mexico, two prominent countries with large export processing
sectors (roughly two thirds of exported Manufactures originates in
these sectors) and key trading partners with the U.S.32We present
supplementary calculations below that adjust the value added con-
tent of exports using an adaptation of a procedure from Koopman
et al. (2008) . The basic idea is to measure the share of exports and im-
ports that ﬂow through the export processing sector, and then impute
separate input –output coef ﬁcients for the processing sector so as to
be consistent with these ﬂows. Details of the procedure are presented
in Appendix A. We then compute the value added content of trade
using a new input –output system that includes these amended
tables.33
4. Empirical results
4.1. Multilateral value added exports
Table 1 reports aggregate VAX ratios for each country, grouped by
region.34Across countries, value added exports represent about 73%
of gross exports. The magnitude of the adjustment varies both across
and within regions. At the regional level, VAX ratios are lowest for Eu-
rope (broadly de ﬁned) and East Asia, and higher in the Americas,
South Asia and Oceania, and the Middle East and Africa. Looking
within regions, the new E.U. members (e.g., Estonia, Hungary, Slova-
kia, and the Czech Republic) stand out as having low VAX ratios in
Central –Eastern Europe, while Japan stands out with a high VAX
ratio relative to East Asia.
For China and Mexico, we report two separate calculations of the
VAX ratio in the table, one computed without adjusting for processing
trade and a second adjusted for processing trade.35VAX ratios for
both China and Mexico fall substantially when we adjust for export
processing trade, from 0.70 to 0.59 for China and from 0.67 to 0.52
for Mexico. This brings the ratios for China and Mexico in line with
other emerging markets such as South Korea or Hungary, and is
28Put differently, while quantity choices may re ﬂect price differences across destina-
tions or uses that arise due to transport costs, tariffs, and markups, we value the result-
ing quantity ﬂows at a single set of prices.
29In our framework, the level of value added differs from the one used in national ac-
counts. We calculate value added as output at basic prices minus intermediates at basicprices, whereas the national accounts calculate value added as output at basic pricesminus intermediates at purchaser's prices.
30Proportionality assumptions are so common in input –output accounting that many
countries, including the U.S., even construct the import matrix ( AIi) itself using a pro-
portionality assumption in which imported inputs are allocated across sectors in the
same proportion as total input use (aggregating over imported and domestic inputs).
Some countries augment this data with direct surveys of input use in constructingimported input use tables. However, no countries (to our knowledge) directly collectinformation on bilateral sources of inputs used in particular sectors.31Puzzello (2010) compares factor content calculations with and without the propor-
tionality assumption using IDE-JETRO regional input –output tables for Asia. Koopman et
al. (2010) compute value added content using disaggregate data classi ﬁed under the
BEC system to estimate bilateral intermediate goods ﬂows. While relaxing proportionality
seems to have small aggregate consequences, it may simultaneously have large effects onvalue added trade at the sector level. This remains to be explored.
32For Mexico, we classify exports originating from maquiladoras as processing ex-
ports. For China, we use estimates from Koopman et al. (2008) constructed from Chi-
nese trade statistics, obtained from Zhi Wang.
33We perform this calculation at a higher level of aggregation than our baseline cal-
culation, with three composite sectors. We believe the results are not very sensitive toaggregation, as aggregate value added ﬂows are nearly identical in the original, unad-
justed data whether computed using 57 sectors or 3 composite sectors.
34We omit ratios for composite regions from the table.
35In the calculation adjusted for processing trade in China and Mexico, VAX ratios in
all countries change relative to the unadjusted benchmark calculation. The absolute
size of the changes in aggregate VAX ratios is very small, with a median of 0.016 and90% of changes less than 0.053. Therefore, we report only one set of ratios for all coun-tries other than China and Mexico.230 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
evidence of the low value added to export ratios within each coun-
try's processing sector.36
Moving down a level of disaggregation, we report VAX ratios for
three composite sectors by country in Table 1 as well. The three sectors
are: Agriculture and Natural Resourc es, Manufacturing, and Services.
VAX ratios are typically greater than or equal to one in the Agricultureand Natural Resources and Services sectors, and markedly less than
one in Manufacturing. This cross-sector variation is primarily due to dif-
ferences in the manner in which each sector engages in trade, rather than
differences across sectors in the degree of participation in cross-border
production sharing. Further, differences in value added to output ratios
across sectors are also an important source of variation.
To sort through these in ﬂuences, we refer back to Section 2.2.3 . Re-
call sectoral VAX ratios would tend to be low when exports are used to
produce foreign goods that are ultimately absorbed at home. If we as-
sume that all output was absorbed abroad, then the output needed to
produce exports would be: ~yix¼I−Aii ðÞ−1∑j≠ixij/C0/C1
, where ~yis used36For the processing sector, we estimate that China's VAX ratios is 0.13, while Mex-
ico's VAX ratio is 0.08. These ratios measure the value added produced within the pro-
cessing sector as a share of processing exports. These ratios represent a lower bound onthe domestic content ofprocessing exports, since the processing sector purchases in-termediates from other domestic sectors.Table 1VAX ratios by country and sector.

to signify that this is a counter-factual value and ~yix¼∑j≠iy˜
ij. Then the
counter-factual sectoral value added to export ratios would be:risðÞ~yix
xisðÞ,
with xisðÞ¼∑j≠ixij. In our data, this counter-factual calculation yields
ratios that are very close to the actual VAX ratios. As such, differences
across sectors in the degree of foreign absorption of exports do not ap-
pear to drive the VAX ratios. Further, we note that differences in value
added to output ratios also cannot explain the full variation in VAX ra-
tios across sectors. In the data, the value added to output ratio in Manu-
factures is roughly 0.25 lower than in Agriculture and Natural Resources
and Services sectors. This goes part of the way toward explaining differ-
ences in VAX ratios across sectors, but falls substantially short.
The remaining driver of variation in VAX ratios across sectors is
cross-sector variation in the extent to which sectoral output is direct-
ly exported versus indirectly exported, embodied in other sectors'
goods that are then exported. Recall that we observe gross exports
from a given sector i :e:;∑jxijsðÞ>0/C0/C1
only if output from that sector
crosses an international border with no further processing. With this
in mind, it is obvious that sector-level VAX ratios are greater than one
when a sector exports value added embodied in another sector's
gross output and exports. In the data, it appears that Manufactures,
which are directly exported, embody substantial value added from
the other sectors. One implication of this fact is that the composition
of aggregate value added ﬂows differs from that of gross trade. Fig. 1
summarizes this fact by plotting the share of Manufactures andServices in both types of trade for the 10 largest exporters. The role
of Manufactures in value added trade is diminished, while Services
is increased by a roughly equivalent amount.
37The upshot is that Ser-
vices are far more exposed to international commerce than one
would think based on gross trade statistics.
To organize the cross-country variation in the data, we construct a
“between –within ”decomposition of the aggregate VAX ratio. The de-
composition is constructed relative to a reference country as follows:

Between Term; ð13Þ
where sdenotes sector, idenotes country, and ω(s) and VAX(s) are
the export share and VAX ratio in sector s. Bars denote referencecountry variables, which are constructed based on global compos-
ites.38In this decomposition, the Within Term varies primarily due
to differences in VAX ratios within sectors across countries, while
the Between Term is in ﬂuenced mainly by differences in the sector
composition of trade. To isolate compositional shifts between Manu-
factures and non-Manufactures, we calculate the decomposition
using two composite sectors, pooling Services plus Agriculture andNatural Resources into a single composite non-manufacturing sector.
Cross-country variation in aggregate VAX ratios is to a large extent
driven by variation in the composition of exports. To illustrate this,
we plot VAX deviations ( VAX
i−VAX) against the Between and Within
Terms separately in Fig. 2 .39In the top panel, the Between Term is a
strong and tight predictor of a country's aggregate VAX ratio. In con-
trast, the Within Term is actually weakly negatively correlated with
the aggregate VAX ratio in the bottom panel, and this relationship is
relatively noisy. This visual impression is naturally con ﬁrmed by a
simple variance decomposition. If we split the covariance of the
Between and Within Terms equally, the Between Term “accounts
for”nearly all the variation in the aggregate VAX ratio.40The Between
Term is dominant because of the large differences in VAX ratios across
sectors. Countries that export predominantly Manufactures, the
sector with the lowest VAX ratio, tend to have low aggregate VAX
ratios as well.
Despite this strong composition effect, aggregate VAX ratios are
only weakly related to the overall level of economic development.
Panel A in Table 2 reports that a one log point increase in income
per capita is associated with a fall in domestic content of 0.8 percent-
age points, though this correlation is not quite signi ﬁcantly different
from zero at conventional signi ﬁcance levels.41This weak aggregate
correlation is a manifestation of two offsetting effects. First, richer
countries tend to have exports concentrated in Manufactures, which
has a relatively low VAX ratio. Second, richer countries tend to export
with higher VAX ratios than poorer countries within composite
sectors, particularly within Manufactures.
To illustrate these offsetting effects, we project the Between
Term and the Within Term separately on exporter income to quan-
tify the relative contribution of each to the overall correlation. In
Panel A of Table 2 , we see that there is a strong negative correla-
tion of the Between Term with exporter income. That is, countries
systematically shift toward manufacturing (which has lower valueadded to output on average) as they grow richer and this depresses
the aggregate VAX ratios. The effect of this on overall VAX ratios is
obscured because the Within Term is signi ﬁcantly positively corre-
lated with exporter income. This positive correlation is mostly due
to the fact that rich countries have higher VAX ratios within Man-
ufactures. Panel B of Table 2 reports the correlation of VAX ratios
for Manufactures with income per capita and splits this into Be-
tween and Within Terms as above.
42The positive correlation be-
tween Manufactures VAX ratios and income is itself driven by a0.2.4.6.8 1Share Sharebel can chn deu fra gbr ita jpn kor usa

37Agriculture and Natural Resources constitutes a roughly equal share of value added
and gross trade.38Reference country VAX ratios for each sector are the ratios of value added exports
to gross exports for the world as a whole. Export shares are the share of each sector intotal world exports.
39The regression line in the top panel is VAX i−VAX ¼0:26/C2Between Term, with ro-
bust standard error 0.04 and R2=0.36. The regression line in the bottom panel is
VAX i−VAX ¼/C00:11/C2Within Term, with robust standard error 0.06 and R2=0.04.
40Speci ﬁcally, the variance breaks down as follows: var(Agg.VAX)=0.01, var(-
Within)=0.03, var(Between)=0.04, and cov(Within,Between)= −0.03. Due to the
negative covariance between the two terms, the variance decomposition is sensitiveto how one chooses to assign the covariance. The scatter plots above can be thoughtof as representing a situation in which one assigns the covariance equally to the twoterms.
41The p-value for a two-sided test that the correlation does not equal zero is 14%. In
this regression, we omit outliers Belgium, Luxembourg, and Singapore. If these threecountries are included, the correlation roughly doubles in size and becomes highly
signiﬁcant.
42VAX ratios for the non-Manufactures composite are positively correlated with in-
come per capita, but the correlation is not signi ﬁcant. Therefore, we do not report these
results separately.232 R.C. Johnson, G. Noguera / Journal of International Economics 86 (2012) 224 –236
positive composition ( “between ”) effect, wherein richer countries
tend to specialize in manufacturing sectors with high VAX ratios.
4.2. Bilateral value added exports and balances
For a particular exporter, bilateral VAX ratios differ widely across
destinations. For concreteness, we graphically present bilateral
value added to trade ratios for the two largest exporters, the U.S.
and Germany, in Fig. 3 . In the ﬁgure, value added to import ratios
are VAX ratios for each country exporting to the U.S./Germany,
while value added to export ratios are recorded for U.S./German ex-
ports to each country.43
Looking at the U.S., there is wide variation in VAX ratios. For some
partners, value added exports are quite close to gross exports. For ex-
ample, the difference between gross and value added exports to the
U.K. amounts to only 3% of gross exports. For others, gross trade ei-
ther overstates or understates the bilateral exchange of value added.
Value added exports to Canada are $77 billion (40%) smaller than
gross exports, and value added exports to Mexico are $40 –$50 billion
(36–44%) smaller. Value added trade falls by a similar proportional
amount, between 30 and 50%, relative to gross trade for countrieslike Ireland, Korea, and Taiwan, which are well-cited examples of pro-
duction sharing partners. At the other end of the spectrum, several
countries have VAX ratios toward the U.S. above one. For example,
countries on Europe's Eastern periphery (see Russia) have bilateral
VAX ratios above one mainly because they supply intermediates to
Western European countries that then end up being consumed in
the U.S. Further, commodity producers (see Australia) also often
have ratios above one.
The U.S. data are representative of general patterns in the data.
44
Looking at Germany, discrepancies between value added and grosstrade also vary in meaningful ways across partners. Value added
trade is scaled down quite substantially for the vast majority of its
large European partners, in contrast to the U.S. This surely is an indi-
cation of the integrated structure of production within the European
Union and its neighbors. Consistent with anecdotal evidence, this is
most pronounced for the Czech Republic and Hungary. Geography
appears to play a substantial role, as trade with partners of similar in-
come levels such as the U.S. and Japan is relatively less distorted.
One consequence of these trade adjustments is that bilateral trade
balances differ when measured in gross versus value added terms.
Fig. 4 displays three measures of bilateral balances for the U.S.: the bi-
lateral trade balance, the bilateral value added balance, and the bilat-
eral value added balance adjusted for processing exports in China and
Mexico. In interpreting this ﬁgure, it is important to keep in mind that
multilateral trade balances equal the multilateral value added balance
for each country. Therefore, a decline in the bilateral value added bal-
ance relative to the gross trade balance for one country necessarily
implies an increase for some other country.
Comparing these alternate measures, there are large shifts in bilat-
eral balances in Asia. Most prominently, the U.S. de ﬁcit with China
falls by roughly 30 –40% ($35 –50 billion), while the de ﬁcit with
Japan rises by around 33% ($17 –18 billion). The end result is that
the value added balances (adjusted for processing trade) are nearly
equal for Japan and China. Looking elsewhere within Emerging Asia,
U.S. de ﬁcits with Taiwan and South Korea also rise and U.S. surpluses
with Australia and Singapore fall. Together, adjustments in these ﬁve
countries (Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan)
nearly exactly add up to the fall in the U.S. –China de ﬁcit, which points
to triangular production sharing within Asia with these countries
feeding intermediates to China that are then embodied in Chinese ex-
ports to the U.S.
To understand these adjustments, we focus on the U.S. –China and
U.S.–Japan balances with reference to the decomposition of the value
added balance in Eq. (12). First, looking at China, the VAX ratio for
U.S. exports to China exceeds the VAX ratio for imports by about 8%
in the unadjusted calculation and 4% in the adjusted calculation.
This tends to raise the value added balance relative to the trade bal-
ance, though only modestly (by $10 billion without adjustment and
$5 billion with adjustment).45Second, the value added content of
both bilateral U.S. exports and imports to/from China are well below
one. The simple average VAX ratio across exports and imports is43We display data for the 15 largest trade partners foreach country plus additional
countries selected for illustration purposes, including adjusted and unadjusted bilater-al VAX ratios for China and Mexico. In line with the aggregate results, adjusting for pro-
cessing trade lowers bilateral VAX ratios vis-a-vis these countries but has only modest
effects on ratios for other countries.
44The median bilateral VAX ratio in the data is 0.91, and the 10th−90thpercentile range is
0.59 to 2.07. Approximately 40% of the bilateral VAX ratios are greater than one.45If gross trade were (counterfactually) balanced between the U.S. and China, the
value added balance would show a surplus due to this force alone.

0.80 without adjustment and 0.66 with adjustment. If VAX ratios for
both exports and imports were equal to this average level, this
would imply value added de ﬁcits 20% or 34% smaller than the gross
deﬁcits. This second “level effect ”accounts for most of the adjustment
from gross to value added balances for China (between $25 and
$44 billion of the total change). In contrast, for Japan, this level effect
is virtually nil, as the simple average VAX ratio is near one (literally,
0.98 without adjustment and 1.00 with adjustment). The U.S. de ﬁcit
with Japan rises in value added terms mainly because the ratio of
value added imports to gross imports is high relative to the ratio of
value added exports to gross exports (the VAX ratio for imports is
0.16 higher than for exports in both calculations).
4.3. Inspecting the mechanism: bilateral decompositions
To demonstrate that production sharing drives variation in bilat-
eral VAX ratios, we construct two decompositions in the data. Theﬁrst decomposition splits variation in bilateral VAX ratios into com-
ponents arising from differences in the composition of exports across
destinations and differences in bilateral production sharing relations.
The second decomposition looks directly at how output circulates
within cross-border production chains by (approximately) splitting
bilateral exports into components absorbed and consumed in the
destination, re ﬂected back and ultimately consumed in the source,
and redirected and ultimately consumed in a third destination.
To construct the ﬁrst decomposition, we express the bilateral
VAX ratio as:

Theﬁrst term is equivalent to the Hummels –Ishii –Yi measure of
the domestic content of exports calculated using bilateral exports.
For a given source country, it varies only due to variation in the com-
position of the export basket across destinations.
The second term is a production sharing adjustment. This adjust-
ment depends on the difference between the amount of country iout-
put consumed in j,yij, and the gross output from irequired to produce
bilateral exports to j,I−Aii ðÞ−1xij. When yijbI−Aii ðÞ−1xij, the VAX
ratio is smaller than the bilateral HIY benchmark. This situation arises
when country i's intermediate goods shipped to country jare either
reﬂected back to itself embedded in foreign produced ﬁnal goods or
intermediate goods used to produce domestic ﬁnal goods, or redir-
ected to third destinations embedded in country j's goods. When
yij>I−Aii ðÞ−1xij, the VAX ratio is larger than the HIY benchmark.
This situation arises when country iships intermediates to some
third country that then (directly or indirectly) embeds those goods
inﬁnal goods absorbed in country j.
T oq u a n t i f yt h er o l eo fe a c ht e r mi ne x p l a i n i n gb i l a t e r a lV A X
ratios, we decompose the variance of the bilateral VAX ratio for each ex-
porter across destinations, var ivaij
ιxij/C16/C17
, into variation due to the BHIY Term
versus the PSA Term. Table 3 reports the share of the total variance
accounted for by the BHIY and PSA terms for representative exporters.46
The production sharing adjustment (PSA Term) evidently dominates thedecomposition. This implies that variation in production sharing rela-
tions across partners, not export composition across destinations, drives
the bilateral VAX ratio. Put differently, bilateral VAX ratios are deter-
mined not by what an exporter sends to any given destination, but rath-
er how those goods are used abroad. In concrete terms, even though the
U.S. sends automobile parts to both Canada and Germany, the U.S. VAX
ratio with Canada is lower than with Germany because Canada is part
of a cross-border production chain with the U.S.
To look at production chains more directly, we construct a second
decomposition that splits bilateral exports according to whether they
are absorbed, re ﬂected, or redirected by the destination to which they
are sent. We construct the decomposition using the division of bilat-
eral exports into ﬁnal and intermediate goods along with the output
decomposition for the foreign destination:

and consumed in destination j, including both ﬁnal goods from coun-
tryiand intermediates from iembodied in country j's consumption of
its own goods. The second term captures the re ﬂection of country i's
intermediates back to itself embodied in country jgoods. The third
term is the summation of country i's intermediates embodied in j's
goods that are consumed in all other destinations, i.e., redirected to
third destinations.47
We report the results of this decomposition for informative bilateral
pairs in Table 4 . Looking at the upper left portion of the table, we see that
Japan's exports to China are primarily either absorbed in China or redir-
ected to the U.S. Comparing Japan's trade with China to that with the
U.S., we see that Japanese exports to the U.S. are nearly exclusively
absorbed by the U.S., indicating minimal bilateral U.S. –Japan production
sharing. In contrast, looking at the upper right panel, we see that large
portions of U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico are re ﬂected back to the
U.S. for ﬁnal consumption. Looking at the lower left panel, we see that
sharing a common border with two different countries does not neces-
sarily imply tight bilateral production sharing relationships. German
exports to France are primarily absorbed there, while nearly half ofexports to the Czech Republic are re ﬂected or redirected. Finally, in the
lower right corner, we see that Korea is engaged in triangular trade
with the U.S. and other destinations via China. In contrast, a larger
share of Korean exports to Japan is eventually consumed there. These
results are consistent with our priors regarding the role of China as a
production sharing hub in Asia.

5. Concluding remarks
Intermediate goods trade is a large and growing feature of the in-
ternational economy. Quanti ﬁcation of cross-border production link-
ages is therefore central to answering a range of important empirical
questions in international trade and international macroeconomics.
This requires going beyond speci ﬁc examples or country/regional
studies to develop a complete, global portrait of production sharingTable 3

See the text for details regarding the decomposition. The Median Country is the median
statistic for all 93 countries in the data.
46In the table, we split the covariance equally between the BHIY and PSA Terms. Be-
cause the covariance is small, our conclusions are not sensitive to how we split thecovariance.47This decomposition is only approximate, because the output split used in con-
structing the decomposition is in ﬂuenced by the entire structure of cross-border link-
ages. Nonetheless, this decomposition is informative as it returns shares that areconsistent with the zero order and ﬁrst round effects of the Leontief matrix inversion
(i.e., [ I+A]) describing how ﬁnal goods absorbed in each destination are produced.
We prefer the decomposition in the text to this alternative “ﬁrst-order approximation ”
of the production structure because it adds up to bilateral exports.
48These decompositions are computed without adjusting for processing trade in Chi-
na. Adjusting for processing trade tends to amplify re ﬂection and redirection effects.
Thus, our table understates the amount of redirection within Asia and re ﬂection in
U.S.-Mexico trade.Table 4Decomposing trade: absorption, re ﬂection, and redirection.

See the text for details regarding the decomposition. The entries in the table describe
the approximate share of bilateral exports to each destination that are ultimatelyconsumed in that destination. Shares do not sum to one because we include only thetop four destinations for each bilateral pair. Data is for 2004.235 R.C. Johnson, G.

patterns. This paper provides such a portrait using input –output and
trade data to compute bilateral trade in value added. We document
signiﬁcant differences between value added and gross trade
ﬂows, differences that re ﬂect heterogeneity in production sharing re-
lationships. We look forward to applying this data in future work to
deepen our understanding of the consequences of production
sharing.
Appendix A
The basic idea behind the adjustment for processing trade is to
split the aggregate economy into separate processing and non-
processing units, each with its own input –output structure. Both sec-
tors use domestic and imported intermediates, but they differ in
terms of intermediate input intensity and the source (domestic
versus imported) of intermediates. Further, all output in the export
processing sector is exported.
From the input –output data, we observe the domestic intermedi-
ate use matrix miiand import use matrix as mIifor the economy as a
whole. From trade data, we observe total exports originating from
and imported intermediates used by the processing sector, denoted
xiPand /C22mP
Iirespectively. Output in the non-processing sector, denoted
yiN, is calculated by subtracting xiPfrom total output in the input –out-
put accounts. We seek separate intermediate use matrices for the two
sectors { miiN,miiP,mIiN,mIiP} and value added by sector { vaiN,vaiP} that sat-
isfy:

where ιis a conformable row vector of ones and ι′is its transpose.49
If there are Nsectors, then there are 4( N×N)+2 Nunknowns
and only 2( N×N)+3 Nconstraints so we cannot solve directly for
the unknown coef ﬁcients. We therefore follow Koopman et al.
(2008) and use a constrained minimization routine to impute the
unknown coef ﬁcients, where the objective function minimizes
squared deviations between imputed values and target values. Tar-
get values are set by splitting intermediate use and value added
across processing and non-processing sectors according to theirshares in total output.
With the resulting split tables, we use bilateral trade data as in the
main text to construct bilateral sourcing matrices and the global
input –output table.
50In performing the calculation, we use processing
trade shares from Koopman et al. (2008) for China. For Mexico, we
obtain trade data for the maquiladora sector from the Bank of Mexico.
Due to concerns about the quality of disaggregate data and the accuracy
of the imputation procedure for individual sectors, we aggregate thedata to 3 composite sectors prior to imputing coef ﬁcients. Because bilat-
eral value added trade results are essentially identical in the main data
when computed with 57 sectors or 3 composite sectors, we believe ag-
gregation does not result in diminished accuracy.
