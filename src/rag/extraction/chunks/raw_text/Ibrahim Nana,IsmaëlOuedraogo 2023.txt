Abstract:  Newton's Law  of gravitation , when applied to international trade, implies that just as particles 
attract each other in proportion to their size and mutual distance, trade flow between two bilateral pairs  is 
proportion al to their respective economic size and bilateral  distance.  The introduction of gravity models in 
economics has revealed the impact of physical distance on bilateral trade.  However , distance might not be 
only physical.  Considering  the significant geopolitical changes affecting the world, this article examines 
whether geopolitical distance has an impact on bilateral trade. Using bilateral trade data for 141 countries 
between 1980 and 2021, the current study used a Pseudo -Poisson Maximum Likelihood  and an 
Instrumental Variable approach  to assess the impact of geopolitical distance between bilateral pairs on 
their bilateral trade  flows . It provide s evidence of the negative impact of geopolitical distance on bilateral 
trade. The study show s that in international relations , friendship between countries is as important as  
neighborhood . Furthermore, the results  demonstrate that geopolitical distance exacerbates the negative 
impact of physical distance on bilateral trade. The results also show that th e negative impact of 
geopolitical distance  on bilateral trade  is valid for trading partners  from  different income groups.

1. Introduction  
Despite the decrease in transportation and transaction costs , distance remains a key determinant 
of international trade  relations . Traditional gravity models, widely used to study bilateral trade, have 
shed light on the influence of physical distance and cultural ties on trade flows (Baltagi et al., 2003; Egger, 
2000; Silva and Tenreyro, 2006; Zhou, 2011) . However, sin ce the 90s there has been a widespread 
perception that globalization  wave s have suppressed  the negative impact  of ‘‘distance’’  on bilateral trade.  
The decline  in transaction costs, especially transport ation  costs  led to a dispersion of economic activit ies 
around the world, favoring the phenomenon of global value  chains and globalization  and leading to the 
so-called death of distance  (Cairncross, 1997) . However, studies based on the traditional gravity model of 
international trad e confirm th at the negative association between distance and bilateral trade flows remain s 
effective (Brun et al., 2005) . More recently,  (Antràs and De Gortari, 2020)  through their theoretical 
approach showed that the optimal location of production at a given stage in a  global value chain  is shaped 
by the proximity of that location to the precedent and the subsequent desired locations of production . 
Thus,  physical  distance remains important even in a world characterized  by fragmented production stages.  
However , physical proximity does not always guarantee economic proximity  and friendly 
relationship s. Practical  cases have shown that physical proximity is not always a determinant of 
economic proximity. Despite  their proximity (or contiguity ), countries can remain separated by ideological  
and geopolitical  distance s, historical conflicts , and cultural differences . For instance , countries such as 
South Korea and North Korea have limited economic interactions despite their physical proximity . 
However , South Korea is economically tied to the United States of America (USA) compare d to North 
Korea . Similarly, despite geographical proximity and cultural similarities with China, South Korea , and 
Japan  seem  to be economically  and geopolitically  close  to the USA  compared to China  (Ellen Kim and 
Victor C ha; Ho, 2018 ). Historical evidence  which  dates back from the Cold War  also suggest that within 
Germany, West and  East Germany's  economic relationships were reduced despite their contiguity  
(American Embassy 1965 ; Ahlfeldt et al., 2015 ). All these cases  suggest that distance can also be 
ideological/geopolitical , and this aspect of distance can also  constrain  international trade.  
In an ever -changing  and interlinked world marked by growing geopolitical tensions, the 
integration of geopolitics into economics is becoming essential.  The world is currently facing a 
geopolitical fragmentation  worsened and revealed b y the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. In the face of  
dynamic global challenges, traditional factors of international trade, such as physical distance and cultural 
ties, seem insufficient to explain current trade relations. For instance, Janet Yellen1 stresses the need for 
the USA  to encourage "friend -shoring" of supply chains to ensure secure access to markets and reduce 
 
1 U.S. Treasury Secretary since January 25, 2021  
economic risks  (dmalloy, 2022)2. This trend towards trade based on geopolitical proximity is 
strength ening, making it necessary to rethink the concept of distance in gravity  models to account for 
geopolitical  distance as a driver of bilateral  trade.  Thus, the analysis of bilateral trade requires a broader 
perspective integrating the impact of geopolitical distance in addition to physical distance, to better 
understand the challenges of contemporary trade . 
The current empirical study takes note of this need  to account for geopolitic s and assess es the 
empirical impact of geopolitical distance on bilateral trade . While physical distance remains a 
significant determinant  of bilateral  trade, it is crucial to account for geopolitical distance which became 
essential as it has proven to be a pivotal factor in shaping international relationships.  In this regard, the 
present study aims to examine the influence of geopolitical distance on bilateral trade, in addition to 
physical distance.  Using bilateral trade data of 141 countries from  1980 to 2021, we relied on  the 
augmented gravity model in which we consider the concept of distance as a function of physical distance, 
cultural links , and geopolitical distance  to assess the impact of geopolitical distance on bilateral trade . To 
address the potential endogeneity of geopolitical distance , we adopt an Instrumental Variables (IV) 
approach, using the  difference in the  political system  between bilateral pairs as an instrument, 
distinguishing between democracies and autocracies.  
The findings suggest that f riendship matters  and geopolitical distance  even deepens the negative 
impact of physical distance on bilateral trade. The findings of our study reveal interesting  conclusions  
in line with the current events , highlighting the negative  impact of geopolitical distance on bilateral trade, 
like that of physical distance. To explore these dynamics, we rely on  a simple Ordinary Least Squares 
(OLS) model and a  Pseudo -Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) model, controlling for fixed effects  
and we further rely on an instrumental variable (IV) approach . Subsequently, we extend our analysis to 
examine the effects of geopolitical distance on different types of products, distinguishing between primary 
goods, mineral fuels, and industrial goods.  The results highlight that geopolitical distance impacts the trade 
of primary products as well as the trade of  mineral fuel , with a higher impact on mineral fuel trade . The 
study also reveals that geopolitical distance amplifies the negative impact of physical distance on bilateral 
trade . Interacting physical distance with geopolitical distance, the results indicate that as geopolitical 
distance increases, the negative impact of physical distance intensifies, thereby underscoring the 
interconnectedness of these two factors.  Finally, our analysis reveal s heterogeneity in the impact of  
geopolitical  distance  on trade relationships . In particular, the study shows that  the negative impact  of 
geopolitical distance on bilateral is valid for both  advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and 
developing economies (EMDEs).

2. Literature review  
The trade -geopolitic s relationship  has been addressed in several  important scientific articles. These articles 
explore d how geopolitical factors, such as trade policies, alliances , and international tensions, influence d 
trade between countries. They highlight ed the importance of national interests, political relations,  and 
geopolitical dynamics in determining trade policies and the functioning of the global trading system.  These 
studies can be classified  between  aggregated  simple country -level analyses and bilateral analyses.  
First, several  studies have assessed the impact of geopolitics on international relationships in a simple 
country -level analysis, relying on proxies  for the measure of  geopolitics . One of the periods in history 
marked by high geopolitical is the Cold War . The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension marked 
by competition and confrontation between communist nations led by the Soviet Union and Western 
democracies including the USA , highlighted  the impact of political intervention on trade during the Cold 
War. It reveals that countries receiving economic aid from the USA  saw their exports increase, while those 
subject to economic sanctions experienced a decrease in exports. In addition, US companies have 
benefited from the political influence exerted by the USA , particularly in the energy and raw materials 
sectors. Investors have also benefited from access to confidential information on US political plans, which 
has influenced their investment decisions. These results , among the pioneers of  studies on  geopolitics , 
highlight the significant impact of geopolitics and political relations on trade and investment during the 
Cold War.  More recently, (Ahir et al., 2022)  presented  the World Uncertainty Index (WUI), which 
measures global economic uncertainty by aggregating data from a variety of sources . The measure of 
uncertainty includes uncertainty caused by geopolitical tensions . It highlights the negative impact of this 
uncertainty on economic growth, investment , and international trade, particularly in low -income countr ies. 
Macroeconomic policies tailored to each country can mitigate these negative effects, but international 
support is needed to strengthen their capacity to cope with economic uncertainty. The WUI provides a 
valuable tool for assessing the impact of economic uncertainty on different sectors and countries, and for 
guiding economic policy decisions.  Following the same approach, (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022)  highlight  
the importance of the geopolitical risk index (GPR) based on an analysis of international p ress articles. 
According to this  paper , the GPR increases significantly during major geopolitical events, which have 
significant economic repercussions, particularly on international trade through stock market fluctuations 
and changes in interest rates. Indeed, geopolitical risk plays a crucial role in the volatility of crude oil prices 
on the international market, as (Fang et al., 2023)  point  out. Moreover, it has a significant impact on the 
efficiency of the gold market, which can have consequences for natural resources trade  (including gold)  in 
key economies such as India, the USA, and Brazil, as mentioned in (Bhatia, 2023) . (Hoekman et al., 2023)  
using  a qualitative analysis method based on a review of existing literature and a conceptual analysis of 
current trends in international trade and global governance highlights the impact of current geopolitical 
tensions on the functioning of the WTO  and proposes reforms to strengthen the organization . These 
reforms , with potential ly important implications for developing countries , focused on improving 
transparency, strengthening dispute settlement mechanisms , and modernizing  trade rules. The document 
also highlights the importance of international cooperation in tackling global challenges such as climate 
change and the COVID -19 pandemic. It stresses the need for broader reflection on global governance and 
ways of strengthening international cooperation in a context of increased geopolitical competition. In 
addition, (Ambrocio and Hasan, 2021)  identif y the link between political linkages and sovereign credit 
ratings and yields on sovereign bonds. The results of this study highlight the influence of political ties on 
the sovereign borrowing conditions of recipient countries, notably through high levels of regime similarity, 
diplomatic contacts , and coalition troop contributions. This political dimension of economic and financial 
relations between countries adds an important perspective to the overall understanding of international 
dynamics.  
Second, some studies have also made efforts to assess  the impact of geopolitics relying on bilateral data , 
showing how bilateral geopolitical relationships can impact international bilateral relationships. (Bao et al., 
2020)  highlight s the impact  of bilateral attitudes on international trade . They show that c ountries with 
positive attitudes towards each other tend to trade more, while negative attitudes lead to a decrease in 
trade. These robust results, obtained using different estimation methods, highlight the importance of 
bilateral attitudes in trade relat ions. (Kleinman et al., 2020)  complements these findings by highlighting the 
correlation between bilateral political alignment and actual economic exposure between countries. It 
demonstrates that UN voting similarities and bilateral political alignment produce similar results. This 
positive relationship persists even after controlling for bilateral trade. Hub and authority measures are 
used to analyze changes in the centrality of countries in the network of real economic exposure. In 
addition, a measure of real economic exposure based on a constant elasticity trade model is developed, 
offering an interpretation of the underlying economic mechanisms.  Geopolitical tensions can also be a 
source of geo -economic fragmentation, as the IMF points out in its analysis of the risks and benefits of 
geopolitical tensions and their impact on the global economy  (Jakubik and Ruta, 2023) . According to the 
IMF, the increased geopolitical vulnerability of emerging and developing economies could influence 
foreign direct investment flows and the economic performance of these countries.  In a gravity model that 
controls for other potential drivers of FDI flows , the IMF shows in its economic outlook that the impact 
of geopolitical alignment is significant and economically relevant, particularly for EMDEs . They 
concluded by providing policy recommendations including the fact that multilateral efforts are needed to 
preserve global integration and reduce the economic costs of fragmentation. The exchange of information 
through mul tilateral dialogue can help to minimize  political uncertainty and reduce cross -border  economic 
consequences.  In bilateral geopolitical relationships , some case studies (focusing on specific countries) 
appeared in the literature. (Tran, 2022)  highlights the use of economic relations as a weapon to achieve 
geopolitical and national security objectives. It mentions the technological disassociation between the USA 
and China, particularly in the semiconductor and telecommunications sectors. The US is increasingly 
dependent on imports of critical minerals controlled by China and Russia, while pressures on drug costs 
make it difficult to relocate pharmaceutical supply chains away from China. This concept of ’friend -
shoring’ can lead to further fragmentation of global supply chains and increased costs for companies.  
(ElGanainy et al., 2023)  highlights the factors that influence foreign policy alignment with China . These 
factors  includ e the importance of regime similarities, diplomatic contacts , and Chinese weapons’ trade . 
Geopolitical and political considerations shape not only the choice of contractual partners but also the 
depth of economic integration policies according to the analysis of (Hinz, 2023)  using a theoretical and 
then empirical approach. It suggests that economic integration can be used as a foreign policy tool, with 
significant variation between countries regarding their ability to do so. Larger countries consider political 
and economic motivations, while for smaller countries political importance and attitude towards the larger 
country are less determining.  
While these  studies have somewhat assessed the  relevance  of geopolitical relationship s on international 
trade and investment, none of them have undertaken a direct approach. The new measure  of geopolitical 
distance constructed by (Bailey et al., 2017)  provides the opportunity to revisit the impact of geopolitical 
distance on bilateral  trade, distinguishing from previous studies through the measure of geopolitics and 
the methodology used.  The current stud y will rely on a gravity model  and will align with studies  such as 
(Cyrus, 2012)  that examine d the extent to which cultural proximity influences trade , using geopolitical 
distance as an independent variable .   
3. Methodology and Data  
The current study seeks to estimate the impact of geopolitical distance on trade. Using a sample of 141 
countries over the period 1980 -2021, the paper relies on a gravity model and shows that distance is not 
only physical but also ideological /geopolitical . 
3.1. Conceptual framework of the gravity model  
Several trade studies have relied on gravity models for their empirical specifications. The basic model 
explains trade flows between two countries (" i" and " j") by their size or wealth (GDP) and, inversely, the 
geographic distance between the two countries . The concept of distance and proximity includes physical 
distances, historical proximity, and cultural distance (common language, common border, and other 
factors affecting trade barriers). The model was used in the 1960s by (Hasson, 1964)  and (Pöyhönen, 
1963)  to study trends in global trade. It was first introduced in the economics world by (Isard and Peck, 
1954) . The gravity model of trade is defined most simply as:    
𝑋𝑖𝑗= 𝐾𝑌𝑖𝛼𝑌𝑗𝜃
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑗𝛽 (1) 
Including the concept of geopolitical distance to equation  (1) and considering distance  as a function of 
physical and geopolitical distance, equation (1) becomes:  
Linearizing equation (2), we obtain the following results:  
Following the traditional approach of the gravity model of trade, this paper relied on an augmented gravity 
model with additional variables, such as common official language, common colonizer, common borders,  
trade agreements, and geopolitical distance . Thus, our empirical model based on the augmented gravity 
model is presented as follows:  
Where 𝑿𝒊𝒋𝒕 stands for bilateral trade value between i and j during the period t; Y stands for the value of 
nominal GDP of the trading partners; 𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕𝑷𝒉𝒚𝒔 𝒊𝒋 is the absolute physical distance between the trading 
partners;  𝑫𝒊𝒔𝒕𝑮𝒆𝒐𝒑𝒐𝒍 𝒊𝒋𝒕 is the geopolitical distance between the trading partners 𝑳𝒂𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒋 represents 
common official language; 𝑪𝒐𝒍 𝒊𝒋 represents colonial links; 𝑪𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒈 𝒊𝒋 represents bilateral pairs with 
common borders ; 𝑻𝑨 𝒊𝒋 represents trade agreement between i and j, including regional trade agreements 
and currency unions. K is a constant.  
Equation (4) is estimated using the OLS estimator  and the Poisson Pseudo -Maximum Likelihood  (PPML)  
estimator  applied to the n onlinear form  of equation (4) is used for robustness check . The use of the 
PPML  estimator  for our robustness checks is a strategic choice that responds to a common problem 
generally faced by gravity models. In bilateral trade data, pair countries that did not trade in a given period 
reported values of zero. So, if bilateral trade between nations is zero and if we estimate them using a 
conventional log -linear model, these zero observations are dropped from the sample as undefined. 
Consequently, the number of observations decreases . In addition, the PPML  estimator  is a robust 
approach in the presence of heteroskedasticity (Tenreyro and Silva, 2006) . This method can be applied to 
the levels of trade, thus estimating the non -linear form of the gravity model directly.3 However 
independent of the problem mentioned, our independent variable namely geopolitical distance may be 
impacted  by reverse causation raising the problem of endogeneity.  
 
 
 
3 In a PPML specification, the dependent variable is trade, not the logarithm of trade, whereas the explanatory variables can s till be in 
log forms. A major requirement of PPML estimation is that the variable should have only positive values.   𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡= 𝐾𝑌𝑖𝛼𝑌𝑗𝜃

3.2. Endogeneity   
The impact of geopolitical distance on bilateral trade is not exogenous and may suffer  from endogeneity.  
Geopolitical distance can impact trade  while  engaging in more trade with a specific partner can lead to 
geopolitical convergence  or divergence . For instance, the economic and trade ties between India and 
Russia have bolstered their geopolitical cooperation (Desai, 2007) . The current study has considered the 
potential problem of endogeneity and proposed two approaches to solving it. First, we relied on lagged 
geopolitical distance in the estimation to counter the reverse causation in the relation between bilateral 
trade flow and bilateral geopoliti cal disagreement4. This approach helps reduce the reverse causation.  
Second, we used an instrumental variable (IV) approach to solve the endogeneity problem  (Wooldridge, 
2002; Poppo et al., 2016; Zhou and Li, 2012; Li and Zahra, 2012; Tang and Wezel, 2015) . The IV 
approach will use the difference in the natural political systems between the bilateral pair as an instrument.  
By doing this, we are considering the level of geopolitical distance generated by differences in political 
systems between countries, making it exogenous to international trade.   
 
The polity2 score provides a measure of the political system of a country (autocracy vs. democracy). The 
difference between the polity2 score will be used as an instrument since it allows the identification  of 
democracies and autocracies. The idea behind this instrument is to identify the impact of external changes 
in bilateral geopolitical distance on bilateral trade . To do so we rely on changes induced by the difference 
in the governance system in place  in bilateral pair countries as an instrument . Generally, these systems are 
the results of long history and cultural fact s. This instrument is exogenous and exclusive. The only way the  
difference in governance  system s can impact bilateral trade is through its impact on countries' 
relationships (bilateral geopolitical distance ). One can argue in favor of the fact that democracies are 
associated with economic growth  and trade. However, the  studies investigating the impact of democracy  
present mixed results ( e.g., (Pozuelo et al., 2016) ). Also,  in terms  of relevance , differences  in governance 
systems are highly correlated with bilateral geopolitical distance. Most  of the time, there are natural 
geopolitical tension s between countries with different governance systems (e.g., USA vs. Russia or USA 
vs. China).  
 
4 The use of lagged independent variables is frequently applied to alleviate the concerns inherent in the endogeneity induced b y 
simultaneous phenomena (e.g.  (Tang et al., 2014) ; (Griffith et al., 2017) ). This strategy consists in introducing a time lag between the 
variables concerned, thus enabling a finer distinction to be made between short - and long -term repercussions, while reducing the 
biases arising from concomitant fluctuations. However, proper selection of time lags and precise model formulation remain imp erative 
to guarantee eminently accurate results. In our case study, we postulate that policy measures and decision -making influencing 
geopolitical configurations require a time interval to be implemented and generate a measurable impact on bilateral trade. Th e use of a 
one-period lag could thus reflect this implementation delay and help capture gradual effects over time, while allowing for greate r 
apprehension of immediate economic responses.  AutocracyPolitical System:

3.3. Data sources  and stylized facts  
3.3.1.  Variables definition and sources  
Most of the variables used in our estimations come from the  CEPII databases . The dependent variable 
comes from CEPII databases on bilateral trade. The independent variable that captures uncertainty comes 
from  (Bailey et al., 2017) . All control variables are obtained from the CEPII databases . Trade agreement 
data are obtained from Mario Larch's Regional Trade Agreements Database ( Table 1).

Physical distance  CEPII database  
Cultural & Colonial links  CEPII database  
Trade agreements  Mario Larch's Regional Trade Agreements Database6 
 
Focusing on the control variables, their potential impact on trade is presented as follows: (i) GDP 
captures the country's economic size and wealth. It also gives information on the ability of governments 
to manufacture export -oriented products and their capacity to import. It is a proxy of economic 
development. Thus, this variable should have a positive effect on bilateral trade . (ii) The distance variable 
represents bilateral physical distance. A higher physical distance  affects transportation costs, raising the 
unit price of the final product for sale and reducing its demand. Therefore, distance should negatively 
impact bilateral trade . (iii) Similarly,  to physical distance , geopolitical distance was  also included in the 
model to account for the level of geopolitical distance between bilateral pairs . This variable is 
complementary to the physical  distance variable. An increase in geopolitical distance is expected to reduce  
bilateral trade. (iv) Colonial and cultural links also matter in explaining bilateral trade. We, therefore, 
expect a positive impact of some of these variables. (v) Finally, trade agreements (regional agreements and 
currency unions) should help increase trade volume. Thus, partner countries that are in the same regional 
trade agreement or currency union should trade more.

5 This is founded upon the voting records at the United Nations General Assembly spanning from 1946 to 2021. The approach comme nces by 
initially estimating an ordered logit model across the three potential voting choices (affirmative, abstention, negative), wh ere the selection hinges 
on the model's parameters combined with a latent country -specific voting preference for any given year. The latent process is gauged by imposing 
Bayesian precedence on the preferences and subsequently employing a Metropolis -Hastings/Gibbs sampling algorithm to deduce the parameters 
of the logit model, followed by the posterior distribution of the latent preference parameters. The distance between two coun tries in each year is 
then calculated as the absolute magnitude of the discrepancy between the inferred vote -specific preference parameters. The database is available

The current study uses an unbalanced panel of bilateral data between  141 countries over the period 1980 -
2021. The average trade value is around US$ 730 million over the period. The average GDP of countries 
in the sample is  US$ 319, 9 billion, with an average GDP per capita of US$ 8,826. The geopolitical 
distance goes from 0 to 5.3 with an average geopolitical distance of 0. 98 (Table 2). The highest level of 
geopolitical distance corresponds to the geopolitical distance between Libya and the USA in 1995. This 
high level of diplomatic disagreement was the result  of repressions against Libya, which refused to 
cooperate with investigations into terrorist acts against Pan Am Flight  103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 
1988, and France’s Union de Transports  Aériens (UTA) flight 772 over the Niger in 1989. As a result , the 
UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to press Tripoli to hand over two suspects 
wanted for the 1988 bombing of the US Pan American Airways airliner. Additional sanctions were 
adopted in  the 1996 US Congress  on firms  doing business with  Iran and Libya . These events explain  the 
high level of geopolitical distance between the two countries.  However, t he lowest level of geopolitical 
distance  is between Panama and Papua New Guinea , two small states with less involvement in geopoliti cs.  
The link between international relationships  and geopolitics is an  old concern. In this section , we 
presented the trade trend and average geopolitical distance trend over the years (from 1980 to 2020 ). 
Figure 1 provides details on the joint evolution of trade (aggregated from bilateral trade data) and average 
geopolitical distance . The figure shows  in some cases a clear negative association between trade and the 
average geopolitical distance between countries . By 2003 -2004 we observed a spectacular divergence 
between global trade and global average geopolitical distance. This observation  means somewhat that the 
spectacular trade increase observed during this period was also accompanied by an important decrease in 
geopolitical distance. While this association is not a causation, it gives an idea of the evolution of these 
two variables. However, Figure 1 does not show  the bilateral dimension  and does not allow us to 
appreciate the impact of geopolitical distance on trade.  
We further divided geopolitical distance observations into quartiles depending on the distribution of the 
variable for the whole sample, the first quantile corresponding to friendly relationships while the fourth 
quartile corresponds to less friendly or conflictual relationships. Figure A 1 shows the trade trend with 
bilateral partners belonging to the first and fourth quartiles . The figure shows that in some cases , bilateral 
trade with friends is hig her than bilateral trade with non -friends. However,  this difference seems to be not 
significant and depends on the period ( Figure A 1), witnessing  the existence of heteroge neity in the 
impact.

To consider these heterogeneities and look more in detail at the relationship between trade and 
geopolitical distance, we  further considered specific cases to assess the bilateral impact of geopolitical 
distance on trade. Relying on the world's top traders namely the USA, China,  and Germany as well as 
some important actors in international geopolitics including Russia, the United Kingdom (UK) , and 
France, we look at the value of international trade between these countries and their partners depending 
on the percentiles of geopolitical distance with these partners as described in Figure A 2 to Figure A 6. In 
other words, we represented these countries' global trade with  their friend ly (first quartile of geopolitics) 
and less friendly partners (fourth quartile of geopolitics ). Figure A 2 to Figure A 6 show that for countries 
such as the USA, France , and the UK , an important share of their international trade occurs with the 
friendliest  partners (partners belonging to the first quartile ). This trend is mitigated for Russia and China . 
This first look at the relationship between geopolitics and trade highlights the existence of a negative 
impact of geopolitic al distance  on trade . However future estimates are necessary for such a conclusion.

While dis tance  is negatively associated with trade , the relation between geopolitical distance and 
trade presents a U -shape form.  Figure 2 shows the relation between trade and both physical and 
geopolitical distance.  Trade is negatively correlated with distance. The higher the distance between 
countries, the lower the value of bilateral trade between them  (Figure 2 B). While  Figure 2 shows a 
simple correlation between trade and distance , it aligns with years of findings from gravity  models linking 
trade  and distance. Figure 2 A show s that the relationship between  trade and geopolitical distance is in the 
form of a U-shape , with distance having a negative impact until a certain threshold of geopolitical 
distance. More estimations are necessary to assess the causal impact of geopolitical impact on trade.  
In addition to physical distance, geopolitical distance matters in explaining bilateral trade flows . 
The current paper assesses  the relationship between bilateral trade  and geopolitical distance.  Using the 
OLS and PPML approaches, the results of the basic model show that friendship is just as important as 
neighborhood.  While  Adam Jakubik and Michele Ruta  in an IMF working paper (Jakubik and Ruta, 2023)  
showed similar findings  relying on the impact of trade uncertainty on bilateral trade with diplomatic 
distance being an aggravating factor, the current paper directly pointed to the negative impact of 
geopolitical distance on bilateral trade. Table 3 shows that a 1 percen t increase in geopolitical distance 
reduces bilateral trade by 0.085 percent (0.029 when using OLS) (columns [1] and [4]).   When considering 
both physical and geopolitical distance, the PPML findings  highlight that a 1 percent increase in 
geopolitical distance reduces bilateral trade by 0.01 percent , while a  1 percent  increase in physical distance 

reduces bilateral trade by 0.57 percent (column [6]). This finding confirms  the importance of geopolitics in 
international trade relations but also highlights  that physical distance still matters even more than 
geopolitical distance.  The finding suggests that the basic gravity model data follows the expectations: GDP  
in the exporting country and GDP in the importing country are positively associated with bilateral trade.  
In addition, a common official language, belonging to the same regional  trade agreement , and contiguity, 
positively impact bilateral trade  as expected  (Table 3).

These findings hold significant importance, although they might be susceptible to model 
specification errors.  Indeed, bilateral data often exhibit correlations, as exchanges between two countries 
can be influenced by common or shared factors. Additionally, each country possesses unique attributes 
that can impact its bilateral exchanges with the rest of the world, not to mention country -specific temporal 
variations. Incorporating fixed effects becomes crucial for more accurate modeling of the inherent 
complexity of international trade. By accounting for country -specific factors and mitigating potential 
biases arising from unobserved heterogeneity, these fixed effects enhance the representation of reality. 
The estimation results, presented in  Table 4, encompass various fixed effects, including those related to 
the importer,  exporter, time, and bilateral pair s in some cases . Thus, we consider the unobservable 
elements linked to countries, time, and the bilateral pair elements  that may not have been considered . It is 
noteworthy that the conclusions remain consistent, indicating that geopolitical distance , in addition to 
physical distance  humpers  trade between countries. Th is finding  holds in both methodological approaches 
(OLS and PPML). Specifically, employing the more robust PPML approach, we observe that a 1% 
increase in geopolitical distance leads to a trade reduction of approximately 0.0053% (column [6]).

4.2. Results of the IV approach  
The current study e mploy s two approaches to mitigate potential endogeneity stemming from  potential 
simultaneity  bias. The first approach involves delaying the independent variable, and the second, using an 
IV method, as described in section 3.2.  By introducing a one -period lag to the geopolitical distance 
variable, we find that similar ly to physical distance, the impact of geopolitical distance aligns closely with 
our main findings, with  significance levels of 1  percent  for most of the findings . According to the findings, 
a 1 percent  increase in geopolitical distance results in a 0.004  percent  decrease in trade, as opposed to a 
0.496  percent  decrease in physical distance  (Table 5, column [3]). However, the use of lagged geopolitical 
distance to address endogeneity through simultaneity bias carries several limitations. While they may help 
mitigate bias, they can also lead to inappropriate extrapolations, loss of temporal information, and reduced 
estimation efficiency. Issues of serial correlation and sensitivity to the specifications of lagged variables can 
also impact the results . Also, in case the lagged variable  remains endogenous, the endogeneity problem is 
only partially resolved. To meet these challenges, we apply a secondary instrumental  variable  approach, 
utilizing the  differences in the  political system  between bilateral pairs  as an instrument for geopolitical 
distance. This method  yields more robust and coherent estimat ions of the causal  impact of geopolitical 
distance on trade . First, the first-stage  results suggest that the instrument is valid. The difference in the 
political system is significantly associated with geopolitical distance , indicating that the instrument is 
pertinent  in explaining geopolitical distance . In addition, the model is exactly identified,  and the F test is 
significant . The results align closely with our core findings: both geopolitical and physical distances exert a 
significantly negative impact on bilateral trade . However, the IV approach suggests a more important 
impact of geopolitical distance compared to the OLS approach . A 1 percent increase in geopolitical 
distance results in a trade reduction of 1. 2 percent , as opposed to a decline of 0.883% for physical distance  
(Table 5, column [6]).

4.3. Commodities and Energy most Influenced by geopolitical 
disagreement.  
We further investigate the impact of geopolitical distance on bilateral trade by type of product/industry. 
The findings complement  the baseline results and show that geopolitical distance negatively impacts the 
bilateral trade of commodities and mineral fuel.  The results show  that energy trade (mineral fuel) is more 
sensitive to geopolitical tensions (Table 6). The use and production of fossil fuels are unbalanced across 
the world, making energy trade between countries necessary to support demand and provide revenue for 
exporters. The international energy market is complex and subject to several distortions. However, it is 
now evident that as economies grow, energy demand increases (Apergis and Tang, 2013) . Oil-exporting 
nations of OPEC are aware of this necessity,  and they discovered in the 1970s that their energy resources 
gave them the ability to put major pressure on larger, richer energy importers  (“Dennis Tänzler | Wilson 
Center,” n.d.)7. Therefore, e nergy has been used for a long time as an instrument of pressure by oil 
exporters in their diplomatic relationships  (“Milestones: 1969 –1976 - Office of the Historian,” n.d.)8. 
Several studies have assessed the link between energy trade and geopolitics. For instance, (Li et al., 2021)  
show that geopolitics has a significant negative impact on the import and export of the energy trade, and 
the inhibition of the export is greater than  that of  the import.   Thus, th e result  of the current section lies 
in previous findings in the literature and  complements the  general observation of the importance of  
geopolitical links in trade relations between countries.

4.4. Geopolitical distance deepens the negative impact of physical distance.  
We also investigated whether the traditional impact  of physical distance on bilateral trade depended on 
geopolitical distance. To answer this question, we introduced a multiplicative term ( interaction between 
physical and geopolitical distance) into equation (4). This analytical approach enables us to better 
understand the complex mechanisms of international trade from a more realistic point of view, by taking 
into account elements that go beyond the simple geopolitical or physical distance. Th e main question that

imposed an oil embargo on Western countries supporting Israel. Oil prices quadrupled, leading to a global economic crisis and  energy shortages in 
many  importing  nations.  This crisis  bolstered  the negotiating  power  of oil-exporting  countries  on the international  stage

Ukrainian pipeline. This created gas shortages in some European countries and raised concerns about the reliability of Russian gas supp lies (Stern 
et al., 2009) . 
we seek to answer in this section is whether the impact of physical distance on bilateral trade depends on 
the level of geopolitical distance . Table 7 presents the results of estimates for this new specification. The 
coefficients in front of physical distance and the interaction between physical distance and geopolitical 
distance are negative and statistically significant, indicating that distance negatively impacts bilateral trade,  
but this negative impact is aggravated as geopolitical distance increases.

Figure  3 presents  the marginal impact of physical distance depending on geopolitical distance. W e 
examine the impacts at different percentiles of geopolitical distance. A 1 percent  increase in physical 
distance results in a 1.2  percent  decrease in bilateral trade between countries positioned at the 25th 
percentile of geopolitical distance (close or “friendly ” countries) compared to the average, and a 0. 91 
percent  decrease between countries positioned at the 1st percentile (very close with substantial geopolitical 
convergence) . However, the same increase in physical distance leads to a reduction of around 1.86 percent  
in bilateral trade between countries at the 75th percentile of geopolitical distance ( geopolitical rivals ) 
relative to those at the mean , and a more important decrease in trade (2.2 percent)  between countries 
positioned at the 99th percentile  (higher rivalry or “non-friends ”).  
These findings support the assumption that geopolitical distance deepens the negative impact of physical 
distance. T he adverse effect s of distance on trade are less perceived or less painful when countries trade 
relatively more with “friendly” partners.  In other words,  in trade  relationships  between friends, distance 
still matters but it becomes a more serious obstacle to trade as soon as strong rivalries arise and relations 
between partner countries deteriorate.

4.5. The impact of geopolitical distance is valid for all income groups.  
We delve deeper into our analysis by investigating the presence of heterogeneity, particularly concerning 
income -based disparities. The impact of geopolitical distance on trade relationships could vary depending 
on income groups. Advanced economies, for instance, often share close geopolitical ties due to their 
economic, political, and security interconnections. They also possess the capacity to wield political and 
diplomatic influence over emerging and developing economies, potentially shaping their trade decisions 
and economic policies.

To ascertain this divergence in the influence of geopolitical distance on trade relationships across income 
categories, we divided our sample into two main groups: advanced economies (AE) and emerging and 
developing economies (EMDE), categorized based on their roles as importers or exporters. The results 
obtained using the PPML approach and instrumental variable method are documented in Table 8. The 
findings reveal that geopolitical distance negatively affects trade, regardless of the income category to 
which the trading partners belong. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this impact remains more pronounced 
when partners do not belong to the same category9. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Our analysis uses bilateral trade data from 141 countries from 1980 to 2021  to investigate the impact of 
geopolitical distance on bilateral trade . By leveraging gravity models and considering geopolitical distance  
as a trade cost and a substantial part of the global distance between nations , this research unveiled 
significant findings  regarding geopolitics and bilateral trade . In the wake of Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, 
this research paper is important and discusses a topic that has long been a determinant in international 
relationships.  It also raises the importance of missing variables in gravity models  using  bilateral  distance as 
a determinant of bilateral trade, while omitting to consider geopolitical distance which is also important.     
First and foremost, the study demonstrates that "friendship" between countries, as well as their 
geographical proximity, plays  a pivotal role in the dynamics of international trade. This observation 
underscores the importance of diplomatic ties and the convergence of foreign policy preferences in the 
development of trade exchanges.  
Specifically, the analysis of the effects of geopolitical distance yielded relevant conclusions. The negative 
impact of geopolitical  distance on bilateral trade of raw materials and mineral fuels is noteworthy, 
particularly pronounced in the energy sector where geopolitical distance  can carry substantial 
consequences. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the unfavorable effect of physical distance on 
trade is exacerbated when geopolitical distance is greater. Furthermore, geopolitical distance negatively 
impacts trade regardless of the income category to which trading partners belong. This highlights that 
even when countries have varying levels of economic development, geopolitical distance remains a 
disruptive factor in their trade relations.  
Thus, this study sheds light on the importance of considering geopolitical distance in the analysis of 
bilateral trade relations. The obtained results provide valuable insights for policymakers and economists, 
underscoring potential challenges related to geopolitical distance and suggesting ways to mitigate its 
negative effects on international trade.   
 
9 Within the PPML approach, an increase of 1% in geopolitical distance leads to a decrease of 0.062% and 0.072% in bilateral tr ade for 
AE-exporter and EMDE -importer relationships, as well as for AE -importer and EMDE -exporter connections (columns [2] and [3]). This 
contrasts with a trade reduction of less than 0.019% observed among countries falling within the same category.
