Abstract  
In this paper , we present new referential statistics for supply chain exposure to 
concentration risk of global production networks.  The study’s net contribution rests on 
the development of a metric that indicates exposure risk in terms of the frequency  of 
supply chain engagement with the regions of analytical concern, alongside the 
traditional approach based on volume measures of valu e-added concentration.  
Japan, a country with a high propensity to encounter natural hazards, and China, 
under mounting geopolitical tension with the United States, are chosen as the target 
regions  for risk assessment. In addition, the highly asymmetric structure of mutual 
economic dependency in the US -China relations is identified .

1. Introduction  
The world  economy in the 21st century has given rise to a new production 
arrangement known as global value chains  (GVCs) , in which production processes are 
sliced and relocated to places where the corresponding tasks are most efficiently 
performed.  Due to  the rapid advancement of transportation modes and information and 
communication technology  (ICT) , production networks continue to expand to cover every 
corner of the globe . Concurrently, the pursuit of opti mal allocation of resources often 
results in the agglomeration and concentration of key production capacities in a certain 
region of a certain country.  
This may work well in  an ordinary environment , but when circumstances 
change  for the worse , such production hubs can become  “choke points” of the entire 
economic system. Multiple examples can be found in recent history: the Lehman Shock, 
the Great  East Japan Earthquake, and various forms of cyber -attacks, where hyper  
economic interdependency rendered production and financial sys tems particularly 
vulnerable to a single point of failure.   
This series of incidents has driven our attention to the systematic risk 
associated with the skewed  concentration of supply chains in global production networks.

 The flow of goods, money, people, and information jointly form a highly compl ex nexus of 
economic activities, and a shock generated in a core  region may rapidly and extensively 
propagate to other regions  across national borders in an unforeseeable manner.  
Against this backdrop, we propose a novel approach to construct a risk indicator 
for firms’ business operations, especially in a global context, by mapping the degree of 
network  concentration of supply c hains. This is done along a line of traditional 
techniques in input -output economics known as the “key sector analysis,” yet with 
methodological augmentation by a compatible analytical framework in network theory.  
The novelty of this study is that we meas ure concentration risks in terms of the 
frequency  with which a particular supply chain passes through a high -risk region, as 
opposed to the  conventional approach  based on a volume  concept . If the analysis is 
directed to supply chain disruptions (such as na tural disasters or geopolitical conflicts), 
then the measurement will reveal the degree of supply chain vulnerability to 
unpredictable incidents in the region of analytical concern.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section pres ents 
a literature review with respect to relevant methodolog ies, showing how our approach 
differs from previous studies. The third section introduce  the basic  model  and the 
mathematical definition s of the metric s. The fourth  section presents  analytical examples

 using multi -country input -output table s, while  the fifth section suggests  possible 
extensions  of the research. The final section concludes  the paper.  
 
2. Literature review  
One of the strengths of input -output analysis is the use of harmonized 
information on sectoral linkages embedded in input -output tables. The values of 
intermediate transactions in the table can be considered as the materialization of inter -
connectedness be tween industrial sectors, from which a multitude of linkage measures 
have been devised. The key sector analysis is based on these sectoral linkage metrics, as 
a certain sector can be regarded as a “key” if it is more connected than others and hence 
able to  inflict a larger impact on the economy.1  
Consider an n -sector economy whose input -output system is represented by the 
following balance equation:  
𝒙=
(  𝑥1
𝑥2
𝑥3
⋮
𝑥𝑛)  =
(  𝑎11𝑎12𝑎13…𝑎1𝑛
𝑎21𝑎22𝑎13…𝑎2𝑛
𝑎31𝑎32𝑎33…𝑎3𝑛
⋮⋮⋮⋱⋮
𝑎𝑛1𝑎𝑛2𝑎𝑛3…𝑎𝑛𝑛)  
(  𝑥1
𝑥2
𝑥3
⋮
𝑥𝑛)  +
(  𝑦1

⋮

1 In regional science, there is a sizable body of literature on the issue of geographic concentration of 
economic activities, which usually refers to spatial distribution metrics such as a generalized 
Herfindahl –Hirschman index or a locational Gini coefficie nt of activities  by regional units  (Fornahl and 
Brenner, 2009) . By contrast, our approach defines concentration in view of the acute asymmetry in the 
network structure of supply chains, hence, it is subsumed under a different strand of studies, along the 
lines of input -output economics and network theory.

 = 𝑨𝒙+𝒚 
… (1) 
where 𝒙=(𝑥1,…,𝑥𝑛)′ is an (𝑛×1) vector with its elements corresponding to the total 
output of each sector; 𝒚= (𝑦1,…,𝑦𝑛)′ is an (𝑛×1) vector containing the final demand for 
products of each sector; and 𝑨 is an (𝑛×𝑛) input coefficient matrix  that represents the 
amounts of intermediate inputs from a row sector directly  used for a unit production by 
a column sector. Thus , we have 𝒙=𝑨𝒙+𝒚 ⇔ (𝑰−𝑨)𝒙=𝒚 ⇔ 𝒙=(𝑰−𝑨)−1𝒚 where 𝑰 is 
an (𝑛×𝑛) identity matrix . Here, we denote  it by 𝑳=(𝑰−𝑨)−1=𝑰+𝑨+𝑨2+⋯ the 
Leontief inverse matrix which represents the amounts of intermediate inputs from a row 
sector used for a unit production by a column sector, both directly and indirectly  (i.e., 
through the higher -order tie rs for sourcing  production inputs ). 
Accordingly, the Leontief inverse matrix in the column -wise direction reveals the 
amount of  demand each sector is able to stimulate in the economy, while in the row -wise 
direction, it shows the amount of supply  needed from each sector by the economy. Thus, 
by comparing the magnitudes of sectors’ column totals (backward linkages) or row totals 
(forward linkages), we can identify which sector is most influential, or key, to the 
economy  as a whole .2

 The k ey sector analysis has a long history  in input -output economics dating back 
to the late 1950s (Rasmussen, 1957; Hirschman, 1958; Chenery and Watanabe, 1958). A 
major advancement from the traditional  approach was observed a decade later, when t he 
hypothetic al extraction method  (HEM ) was proposed and explored . The basic idea of the 
method is that we consider a “hypothetical” input -output system in which a sector in 
question is artificially suppressed, and thereby the importance of this suppressed sector 
for the entire system may be measured by comparing the performances of the actual 
economy ( with  the sector) and that of the hypothetical economy ( without  the sector) . 
Specifically, let 𝑨̅(𝑡)     be a hypothetical input coefficient matrix such that its 
elements  are 𝑎̅(𝑡)𝑖𝑗      = 0 if either 𝑖=𝑡 or 𝑗=𝑡 and 𝑎̅(𝑡)𝑖𝑗      =𝑎𝑖𝑗 otherwise. The HEM impact 
for sector 𝑡 is defined as the difference in the output s of the actual and hypothetical 
economies:  
𝐻𝐸𝑀(𝑡) =  𝒊′𝑳𝒚−𝒊′𝑳̅(𝑡)    𝒚 = 𝒊′(𝑳−𝑳̅(𝑡)    )𝒚 
…(2) 
where 𝑳̅(𝑡)     is the Leontief inverse matrix of 𝑨̅(𝑡)     and 𝒊′ is a row summation vector.  
The e arly developers of HEM were Paelinck et al. (1965) , Strassert (1968) , and 
Schultz (1976) . Temurshoev (2009, 2010) extended the method  for group -wise 
 
matrices, to derive forward/backward linkages. Furthermore, the Leontief inverse matrix was 
subsequently replaced by the Ghosh inverse matrix for the ca lculation of forward linkages.

 identification of key sectors, whereas Dietzenbacher and Lahr (2013) developed it  into a 
more generalized framework.  
The HEM was first introduced into the int ernational context by Dietzenbacher 
et al. (1993) , who used a multi -country input -output table for selected EU countries. The 
multi -country analysis is further elaborated on by  Dietzenbacher  et al. (2019) , in which 
the problem of extracting one or more sectors in a closed input -output system ( leading to 
“imports from Mars”) is dealt with by explicitly considering the substitution of extracted 
sector’s inputs with those from third countries.  
Recent applications of HEM  to internati onal trade are found in the studies of 
global value chains. Los et al. (2016) and Los and Timmer (2018) proposed a simple yet 
precise  interpretation of gross export decomposition into value -added  sources , which 
sheds new light on earlier decomposition meth odologies. In this vein, Miroudot and Ye 
(2021) demonstrate  a comprehensive HEM approach  to gross export decomposition, 
which provides a common platform for quantifying different notion s of value -added 
double counting within a single accounting framework.  
Another  important strand of HEM applications is in the field of environmental 
economics. The identification of the key sectors that impose the largest negative impact 
on the environment is crucial for designing policy tools that effectively reduce

 greenhouse gas emissions (Lenzen, 2003). In this spirit, HEM is applied to 
environmentally extended input -output models of Italy (Ali, 2015) and China (Wang et 
al., 201 3; Zhao et al., 2016) to measure the CO 2 emission linkages in domestic supply 
chains. Using a multi -country input –output model, Hertwich (2021) quantified the levels 
of greenhouse gas emissions and the global carbon footprint of material production.  
Closer to the topic of our  current  interest, Dietzenbacher and Miller (2015 ) 
allude to the possibility of applying HEM to the impact assessment  of natural hazards , 
by referring to the preceding study by Muldrow and Robinson (2014)  on the 2008 Cedar 
Rapids Flood  in the United States . Simila rly, Xia et al. (2019) evaluated  a specific case 
of IT service shutdown during the 2015 York flood in the UK using the HEM.  
Our present  study is different from the se preceding efforts  in several respects. 
The primary focus of previous literature is directed either to wards  the identif ication of  
the most influential sectors for economic/environmental amelioration , structural 
decomposi tion of production systems for a n accounting diagnosis , or posterior impact 
assessment  of a specific  natural  hazard . In contrast, we aim to apply key sector  analysis 
to the precautionary risk management  of global supply chains. The recognition of 
potential “choke point s” in production networks  as key sectors , and the evaluation of 
associated risks in terms of supply chains  concentration , distinguish this paper from

 others with regard to  research motivation, and what necessitates the exploration of an 
unorthodox  approach , which is  unfolded below.  
From the perspective of risk analysis, there are volume  and frequency 
dimensions  of risk assessment. For example, the chances that our families get infected  
with  the virus will be high, either because they visit a risky place  together, or because a 
family member , even if just one,  visits such a place  frequently. Alternatively, perhaps 
even a more straightforward analogy is that event s of earthquakes are reported and 
analyzed with respect to both the magnitude and frequency of occurrence.  
Paraphrasing it to fit  our context, a supply chain is considered highly exposed 
to a specific country risk  if its product contains a significant volume of value -added 
sourced from the country in question , or if the production activities along the supply 
chain involve frequent engagement with  the country’s industrial sectors . The first factor  
is self -evident , but the second factor  is also important because it relates to the probability  
aspect of the supply chain being  caught by contingencies in the country of concern . The 
traditional key secto r analys is, however, can only address the  volume -wise scale of inter -
sectoral  spillovers , be it backward/forward linkages or the HEM . It is, therefore, 
impossible  to capture in isolation these dual attributes  ― volume  and frequency  ― of 
concentration risks .

 With this in mind, the following section  demonstrates a method to  quantify  
supply chain concentration in the frequency dimension, which is expected to serve as a 
complementary me tric to traditional approach of volume -based  measure ment s. 
 
3. Basic m odel and the definition of the indicator  
Prior to the formal exposition of the model, we illustrate the essence of our 
approach using a schematic example. As shown in Figure 1, suppose that the supply 
chain connecting Countries A and  E has four production paths via Country C, which is 
set as the target country. The first path goes through Country C’s industries twice, the 
second path once, the third path twice, and the fourth path once. Accordingly, the average 
number of times (freque ncy) that the supply chain passes through Country C is 
(2+1+2+1) / 4 = 1.5.

Though helpful for an intuitive understanding of the concept, the schema 
presented above is only for an illustrative purpose; supply chains have countless 
production paths in the real world, and it is practically impossible to look into them one 
by one for the entire product ion network.  
Given this, a metric is to be devised to capitalize on the linkage information of 
multi -country input -output tables.  The pass-through  frequency ( PTF) represents the 
average number of times a particular supply chain passes through a target sector  in a 
given production system . It is built upon a property  of structural betweenness centrality 
developed  by Liang et al.  (2016) as a form of key sector analysis . 
Backward propagation of a final demand impact in a (𝑘−1) stage path is

 presented as follows : 
 𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘 𝑦𝑠𝑘 
…(3)  
where  𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑖+1 is an input coefficient from sector 𝑠𝑖 to sector 𝑠𝑖+1, and  𝑦𝑠𝑘 is the final 
dema nd for products of sector 𝑠𝑘. Suppose that the target sector 𝑡 is located among 
intermediary sectors 𝑠𝑖 (𝑖=2,3,4,…,𝑘−1) along the path. Let 𝑢1,𝑢2,…,𝑢𝑙 be the 
upstream sequence of 𝑙 sectors in relation to  sector  𝑡 and 𝑑1,𝑑2,…,𝑑𝑚 be the downstream 
sequence of 𝑚 sectors in relation to  sector  𝑡, where 𝑙+𝑚=𝑘−1 and 𝑢𝑙+1 = 𝑑0 = 𝑡. Then, 
the (𝑘−1) stage path including sector 𝑡 can be represented as 𝑢1,𝑢2,…,𝑢𝑙,𝑡,𝑑1,𝑑2,…,𝑑𝑚 
and Equation (3) can be reformulated a s 
 𝑎𝑢1𝑢2 𝑎𝑢2𝑢3… 𝑎𝑢𝑙−1𝑢𝑙 𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡 𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚 
…(4) 
The structural path  of the impact propagation  from sector 𝑑𝑚 to sector 𝑡 is give n by the 
right half of Equation ( 4), 𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚, hence , the total impact  of all paths  
running up to that point is calculated as  
∑∑…∑(𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚)
𝑑𝑚−1 𝑑2 𝑑1 
=∑ (𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚)
𝑑1,…,𝑑𝑚−1 
…(5) 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
13 
 Then, further propagation from sector  𝑡 for the remaining  path up until  sector  
𝑢1 is the higher -order backward propagation of Equation ( 5) commencing from sector  𝑡; 
that is,  𝑎𝑢1𝑢2 𝑎𝑢2𝑢3… 𝑎𝑢𝑙−1𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡⋅∑ (𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚) 𝑑1,…,𝑑𝑚−1. Accordingly, the 
total impact delivered along  all paths running through the entire  sequence  from sector 
𝑑𝑚 to sector 𝑢1 via sector  𝑡 is calculated as  follows:  
∑ ( 𝑎𝑢1𝑢2  𝑎𝑢2𝑢3… 𝑎𝑢𝑙−1𝑢𝑙 𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡⋅∑ (𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚)
𝑑1,…,𝑑𝑚−1)
𝑢2,…,𝑢𝑙 
= (∑( 𝑎𝑢1𝑢2 𝑎𝑢2𝑢3… 𝑎𝑢𝑙−1𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑢𝑙𝑡)
𝑢2,…,𝑢𝑙)(∑ (𝑎𝑡𝑑1 𝑎𝑑1𝑑2…𝑎𝑑𝑚−1𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚)
𝑑1,…,𝑑𝑚−1) 
…(6) 
Meanwhile, it is known that  [𝑨ℎ]𝑖𝑗, an element of the hth-power of an input 
coefficient matrix 𝑨, indicate s the total amount of impact s delivered from sector  j to 
sector  i for all paths with a length of h (i.e., with h iterations of propagation s). This 
property of the input coefficient matrix allows the reformulation of Equation ( 6) as 
follows:  
[𝑨𝑙]𝑢1𝑡⋅ [𝑨𝑚]𝑡𝑑𝑚 𝑦𝑑𝑚 . 
…(7) 
Specifically, the impact transmission  through the shortest possible path, with only one -
shot propagation for each of the upstream and downstream sequences (i.e., 𝑙=𝑚 = 1, 
propagation  path: 𝑑1→ 𝑡 → 𝑢1), can be presented as follows:  
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
14 
 [𝑨1]𝑢1𝑡⋅ [𝑨1]𝑡𝑑1 𝑦𝑑1 
=𝑎𝑢1𝑡⋅𝑎𝑡𝑑1 y𝑑1 
…(8) 
Finally, we consider every possible combination of an upstream path and a 
downstream path with different length s: 𝑙-stage path for the upstream sequence and 𝑚-
stage path for the downstream sequence , which leads to the following specification of the 
total  impact s delivered through all paths  via sector 𝑡 for respective supply chain s.  
∑∑(𝑨𝒍 𝑱(𝑡)𝑨𝒎 𝒚̂)∞
𝑚=1∞
𝑙=1 
= (∑𝑨𝒍∞
𝑙=1)𝑱(𝑡)(∑𝑨𝒎∞
𝑚=1)𝒚̂ 
= (𝑳−𝑰) 𝑱(𝑡) (𝑳−𝑰) 𝒚̂    
…(9) 
where 𝒚̂ is an (n × n ) diagonal matrix containing the final demand s for its diagonal 
elements and zeros (0s) elsewhere ,  𝑱(𝑡) is an (n × n ) matrix containing 1 for the (𝑡, 𝑡)-th 
element and zeros (0s) elsewhere, and 𝑳−𝑰=𝑳𝑨=𝑨𝑳= 𝑨𝟏+𝑨𝟐+𝑨𝟑+⋯. 
Equation ( 9) shows the entire set of impact propagation s along every path that 
passes through the target sector 𝑡. Note that sector 𝑡 may appear multiple times along a 
path ; that is, more than one of  the sectors 𝑢1,𝑢2,…,𝑢𝑙,𝑑1,𝑑2,…,𝑑𝑚 in Equation ( 4) can 
be sector 𝑡. When this is the case, Equa tion (9) performs multiple counting of an impact 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
15 
 delivered through the corresponding path by the same amount. This happens because 
each sector 𝑡 along the path defines a specific pair of upstream and downstream 
sequences, and each of these pairs additiona lly counts the identical amount of impact 
under Equation (9) (see  Appendix A  for an illustrative example).  
In general, multiple emergence s of target sector  𝑡 along  a path result in  multiple 
counting of identical amount s of impacts by the number of sectors’ emergence. Upon this 
ground, and in  light  of the definition given by Liang et al. (2016),3 Equation ( 9) can be 
expressed as  follows:  
∑∑ ( 𝑐(𝑡)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘 𝑦𝑠𝑘)
𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3 
…(10) 
where 𝑐(𝑡) is the number of times that sector  𝑡 appears on a particular backward linkage 
path  𝑠𝑘→𝑠𝑘−1→⋯→𝑠3→𝑠2→𝑠1 specified  by the multiplicand on the right , that is, 
𝑐(𝑡)=|{ 𝑗 |𝑠𝑗=𝑡}∖{1,𝑘}|. The summation ∑(∙)𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1 is used to embrace  every 
combination of intermediary sectors 𝑠𝑖 (𝑖=2,3,4,…,𝑘−1) for a path with a length of 
(𝑘−1), and ∑(∙)∞
𝑘=3 is to consider every path with a length of more than 2 (i.e., 𝑘≥3). 
Capitalizing on this property , we propose and define  the pass-through  frequency 
of a (𝑖,𝑗) supply chain for sector 𝑡 as 
 
3 The specification in Liang et al. (2016) uses a different notational system.

16 
 𝑓(𝑡)𝑖𝑗=[𝑳 𝑱(𝑡)𝑳− 𝑱(𝑡) ]
𝑖𝑗
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑖𝑗 
… (11) 
Note that , unlike structural betweenness centrality,  we use 𝑳 instead of 𝑳−𝑰 in the 
numerator, which allows for the emergence of target sector 𝑡 at either/both terminal 
points of a path , that is, 𝑐(𝑡)=|{ 𝑗 | 𝑠𝑗=𝑡 }| (Tokito et al. , 2021).  In addition, the term s 
 𝑱(𝑡) and 𝑰 are subtracted from the numerator  and denominator  to ne gate the value s 
corresponding to the initial exogenous demand s, which are analytically irrelevant to 
identifying the structure of the network s. 
As an  analogy to Equation ( 10), the PTF can be alternat ively expressed in the 
form of a structural path , such that  
𝑓(𝑡)𝑠1𝑠𝑘=𝑐(𝑡)𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘+∑∑( 𝑐(𝑡)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘) 𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘 
=𝑐(𝑡)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘+∑∑ (𝑐(𝑡)⋅ 𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘)
𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3 . 
… (12) 
As the denominator [𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘 is the total amount of impact propagation from 𝑠𝑘 to 𝑠1, 
the multiplicands 𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘⁄  and (𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘)[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘⁄  give a share  
of the impact delivered through a particular backward path 𝑠𝑘→𝑠1 (single -stage path) 
or 𝑠𝑘→𝑠𝑘−1→⋯→𝑠3→𝑠2→𝑠1(multi -stage path).

17 
 Accordingly, Equation ( 12) shows that the PTF is equivalent to a weighted 
average  of 𝑐(𝑡), an integer indicating the number of times that target sector  𝑡 appears in 
a particular  (𝑠1,𝑠𝑘) path , using the aforementioned impact shares as weights.  In effect, 
the metric indicates the frequency with which a particular supply chain engages with 
the target sector through the operation of a given production system.4  
The above specification of the indicator offers the following analytical benefits:  
i) It is possible to calculate the value for  a supply chain connecting any two sectors.  
ii) The value can be calculate d from only one data source: an input -output table . 
iii) Given the Leontief inverse matrix of an input -output table,  the value can be 
computed in constant time; hence , the computational cost is low.5 
iv) The indicator has a set of weights as a built -in decay parameter in an economically 
meaningful way so that the value will converge.  
Regarding point iv), let us consider a pair of (𝑠1,𝑠𝑘) paths with different lengths 
yet the same number of times that the target sector appears along the way. A pparently, 
the longer path has a lower density of target emergence than the shorter path, and hence, 
 
4 The PTF has a similar structure to the average propagation lengths (APL) proposed by Dietzenbacher 
et al. (2005). The APL measures the length of  a supply chain connecting a pair of industrial sectors and 
is defined as a weighted average of the number of propagations using impact shares as weights. 
Specifically, 𝐴𝑃𝐿𝑖𝑗= [𝑳𝑨𝑳]𝑖𝑗[𝑳−𝑰]𝑖𝑗⁄  =  [1𝑨1+2𝑨2+3𝑨3+⋯]𝑖𝑗[𝑳−𝑰]𝑖𝑗⁄  = [∑ℎ𝑨ℎ ∞
ℎ=1]𝑖𝑗[𝑳−𝑰]𝑖𝑗⁄  = 
∑{ℎ⋅([𝑨ℎ]𝑖𝑗[𝑳−𝑰]𝑖𝑗⁄ )}∞
ℎ=1 , where h is the number of impact propagations from sector  𝑗 to sector  𝑖. 
5 As  𝑱(𝑡) is an ( n × n ) matrix containing 1 for the ( 𝑡, 𝑡)-th element and zeros (0s) elsewhere, we can 
explicitly denote each (𝑖,𝑗)-element of 𝑳𝑱(𝑡)𝑳 as 𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑙𝑡𝑗.

18 
 it should be assigned a smaller weight when calculating the value  of the indicator . The 
impact shares serve as weights for this purpose because the impact becomes  smaller as 
it goes along a path for higher -order propagation s owing to the property of an input 
coefficient  ( 𝑎𝑖𝑗<1). 
Analogous to  the PTF for a sector, we may also consider the pass -through 
frequency for a transaction , which indicates the frequency at which a particular supply 
chain engages in a target transaction through the operation of a given production system. 
The definition is similar to that for the sectoral m odel, that is,  the average number of 
times that a supply chain passes through a target transaction  specified by a particular 
element in an input -output matrix . Based on the structural betweenness centrality for a 
transaction proposed by Hanaka et al.  (2017 ), PTF for a transaction can be formulated 
as follows : 
  
𝑓(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑠1𝑠𝑘=[𝑎𝑡1𝑡2𝑳 𝑱(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑳 ]𝑠1𝑠𝑘
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘 , 
 
… (1 3) 
where 𝑱(𝑡1,𝑡2) is an (n × n) matrix containing 1 for the (𝑡1, 𝑡2)th element and zeros (0s) 
elsewhere ; see Appendix B  for a detailed exposition of the transactional model.  
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
19 
 Using  this transactional model, we further demonstrate that the impact 
propagations of a particular supply chain can be decomposed in accordance with the 
number of times that the transaction (𝑡1,𝑡2) appears on each propagation path.  We 
define  𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘) as the total amount of impact propagations from 𝑠𝑘 to 𝑠1 such that 
transaction  (𝑡1,𝑡2) appears exactly 𝑟 times  along the paths . In addition , let 𝑨(𝑡1,𝑡2) be a 
matrix such that its elements 𝑎(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑖𝑗      = 𝑎𝑖𝑗 if 𝑖=𝑡1 and 𝑗=𝑡2 while 𝑎(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑖𝑗      =0 
otherwise, and 𝑨̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    =𝑨−𝑨(𝑡1,𝑡2) is a hypothetical input coefficient matrix with respect 
to (𝑡1,𝑡2). Then, 𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘) can be formulated as  
𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘)={[𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    −𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘                                           𝑟=0
[(𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    𝑨(𝑡1,𝑡2))𝑟 𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    ]
𝑠1𝑠𝑘                   𝑟≥1 
… (14) 
where  𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    =(𝑰−𝑨̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    )−1 is the Leontief inverse matrix of 𝑨̅(𝑡)    .  
Now, b ecause 𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)     is derived from the hypothetical input -output system 
extracting (𝑡1,𝑡2) transaction , an element [𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    −𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘 represents the total amount of 
impact propagations from 𝑠𝑘 to 𝑠1 not passing through  the transaction (𝑡1,𝑡2); that is, the 
case of 𝑟=0.  
For 𝑟≥1, 𝑨𝑡1𝑡2 appears exactly 𝑟 times in the matrix multiplication of 
[(𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    𝑨𝑡1𝑡2)𝑟 𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    ]𝑠1𝑠𝑘. This is equivalent to saying that the input coefficient 𝑎𝑡1𝑡2,

 which correspond s to the target transac tion (𝑡1,𝑡2), appears 𝑟 times in each (𝑠1,𝑠𝑘) path 
under [(𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    𝑨𝑡1𝑡2)𝑟 𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    ]𝑠1𝑠𝑘, given the properties  of 𝑨(𝑡1,𝑡2) and 𝑳̅(𝑡1,𝑡2)    . 
Accordingly, 𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘) as defined  above , presents the total amount of 
impact propagations from 𝑠𝑘 to 𝑠1 such that transaction  (𝑡1,𝑡2) appear s exactly 𝑟 times, 
for both cases of 𝑟=0 and 𝑟≥1; see Appendi x C for the calculation result of a case study 
on China’s ICT  equipment  industry.  
 
4. Analytical example  
In this section, we present analytical examples  using multi -country input -
output tables constructed by the Organi sation  for Economic Co -operation and 
Development (OECD). The database was chosen because of its high degree of 
harmonization and consistency among the constituent national input -output tables, 
which are sourced only from the official statistics of individual cou ntries. The latest 
version, published in 2021, is based on 45 industries (concordant with ISIC Rev.4), 
covering 6 6 countries/regions from 1995 to 2018, allowing comprehensive time and 
geographic coverage for GVC  analyses  (see Appendix D  for the description  of the data, 
countries of reference, and industrial sector classification) .

 [Country analyses: Japan  and China ] 
Japan is well recognized as a country that is prone to natural hazards . 
Earthquakes in Japan account for 17. 9% of all cases (larger than magnitude 6.0) reported 
worldwide during 201 1-2020, even though its national territory occupies less than 1% of 
the total land area on the planet (River Databook , 202 1). 
In particular, the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 caused unprecedented 
economic a nd social damage to the country, exacerbated by the multiple chained 
disasters of the tsunami, as well as the breakdown of nuclear power stations. In addition 
to the tragic loss of human lives, the economic impact of disasters on global supply chains 
has a ttracted worldwide attention. For example, the devastating physical damage to 
local factor ies of Renesas Electronics, a car parts supplier, led to  a critical shortage of 
micro -computers for cars and abruptly disactivated the production lines of the 
automot ive industries, both in Japan and foreign countries alike.  
It is not only about the scale but also the scope of natural disasters that reveal  
Japan’s vulnerable position: earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, typhoon, flood, 
rainfall , and snow damage, caused by a very complex interaction  of geophysical and 
meteorological conditions that the country rests on. Accordingly, we chose Japan as one 
of the target regions for supply chain risk analysis.  
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
22 
 Another analytical target is China , which  has achieved rem arkable economic 
growth in the last few decades and has become a global manufacturing center, dubbed 
as “the Factory of the World .” Its economic influence was vividly demonstrated by a bitter 
experience in the wake of the Covid -19 outbreak when production activities in many 
countries came to a halt as parts supplies from the country were suddenly suspended.  
Furthermore, mounting geopolitical tensions between the United States and 
China add another layer to supply chain risks. In the post -pandemic world, th e US -China 
confrontation is considered to escalate, and government intervention in business 
activities is likely to be modus operandi in China, as precedented in the form of export 
controls on key strategic materials or forced technological transfers from foreign 
affiliates operating within the country. Global firms should be well prepared for their 
geopolitical implications in supply chain management.  
Table  1 juxtapose s metrics of the PTF and trade in value -added (TiVA : see 
below ) for 50 cross -border  supply chains ranked by the PTF index , with Japan and China 
(inclusive of  “Hong Kong, China”) being set as the target countries .6 
  
 
6 In Table 1, we only consider the supply chains that do not have a target country  at either terminal 
point of a path in order to highlight the country ’s position as an indirect influencer of supply chains. 
Furthermore, supply chains carrying less than 300 million USD of value -added have been truncated 
from the sample set.

The PTF index is derived from the elements in the aggregate PTF matrix 
benchmarked a gainst the sample average. The aggregate matrix is a linear sum of 45 
PTF matrices, each of which is individually calculated for one of the 45 sectors in Japan 
and China using a multi -country input -output table. Therefore, the index indicates how 
frequentl y the corresponding supply chains engage with any of the 45 industrial sectors 
located in the target country.  
In contrast, the TiVA metric presents the amounts and sources of the value 
embodied in final products, which are ultimately consumed in various locations all over 
the world through international trade. In a matrix form based on a multi -country input -
output table, it maps out flows of the value  added, both within and across borders, 
formulated as 𝒗̂𝑳𝒚̂, where 𝒗̂ is a diagonal m atrix of value -added coefficients (the amount 
of value -added generated by a unit of production), 𝑳 is a multi -country Leontief inverse 
matrix, and 𝒚̂ is a diagonal matrix of final demand with a country dimension.  
At the top of the left panel (target coun try = Japan), for example, it is shown 
that the US car supply chain (USA_29) engages with industrial sectors of Japan at a 
frequency 3.61 times higher than the average to source 377 million USD of value -added 
from a mining sector in Australia (AUS_07T08).  
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
25 
 In general, long supply chains, such as those connecting mining sectors at the 
upstream end (05T06, 07T08) or construction services at the downstream end (41T43), 
tend to show a high frequency of engagement with the target country. This is not 
surprising because longer production processes can be naturally associated with a 
proportionately higher likelihood of foreign exposure for their  demand -supply sequence.  
In this respect, it is interesting to observe high PTF values for the ICT 
equipment sectors in K orea and Chinese Taipei (KOR_26. TWN_26) as value -added 
sources in the right -hand panel (target country = China). The sector is not generally 
considered upstream  as in the cases for agricultural or energy -related industries; hence , 
the observed high pass -through frequency suggests the existence of a complex network 
structure in which multiple production sectors intensively interact with Chinese 
industries back and forth over a relati vely short range of the industrial spectrum.   
Furthermore, the highlighted entries in the table , “Public administration and 
defense; compulsory social security” of the United States (USA_84) , may deserve sharp 
attention . This is a sector -in-charge of the US national security , and it could be rather 
disturbing for  the US policymakers  to observe the high presence of China’s industrial 
sectors in its supply chains from the Taiwanese and Korean ICT equipment sectors.

 Figure 2 present s the relati ve risk positions of the GVC -oriented manufacturing 
industries  in the selected industrialized economies . The horizontal axis gives  the share 
of value  added  sourc ed from the target country , calculated by using  the corresponding 
subset of elements in 𝒗̂𝑳 from the TiVA matrix, while  the vertical axis is the industry’s 
total PTF for all branches of its supply chains , denoted  by the column sums of the 
aggregate PTF matrix  and indexed against  the sample average .7 The dotted lines 
indicate  simple regression s. 
From the perspective of final product producers, TiVA  presents  domestic and 
foreign sources of their product value, revealing the ultimate form of supply chain 
dependence in volume terms.  Therefore, the diagram depicts  the nature of the supply 
chain concentration/dependence of each country -sector  pair along the volume and 
frequency dimensions.

The key findings are as follows : 
- By comparing the two panels, t he data are  more disperse d for China’s case  [1-
b], especially towards the top-right corner of the diagram . This shows that t he supply 
chains of the selected economies are generally more concentrated in China than in Japan, 
but the variation therein is larger  among individual economies and industries.

 - In Japan ’s case  [1-a], the industries of Chinese Taipei stand out as being 
dependent  on the country , especially  with regard to  the shares of value -added origins.  
- China’s case  reveals  that the nature of concentration risks differs between 
advanced economies (Germany, Japan , and the United States ) and emerging economies 
(Korea and Chinese Taipei). The industrial sectors of the former group tend to be 
clustered in the area  above the regression line (volume < frequency), where as those of  
the latter group are mostly found  below the line (volume > frequency) , except for the ICT 
equipment sectors of Korea and Chinese Taipei . Namely, advanced economies are more 
prone to facing concentration risks in terms of frequency rather than v olume.  
This last observation can be  explained by two fact ors. First, because domestic 
markets and the industrial base of advanced economies are sufficiently large, the share 
of foreign value added in their production activities tends to be small. Second , advanced 
economies accommodate many  global firms that organize long and sophisticated supply 
chains with substantial foreign exposure, which increases the ir engagement frequency 
with the target country . 
Focusing on the ICT equipment industry , which is  now widely  recognized  as a 
strategic  sector  in the domain of national security, the supply chains of Korea and 
Chinese Taipei (KOR_26, TWN_26) are the most exposed to  concentration risks in China , 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
29 
 both in terms of volume and frequency . The various diplomatic effort s by the US 
government to “de-couple” the ICT supply  chains away from China’s influence reflect its 
bare recognition of such risks through the lens of  real-world geopolitics .8  
The US supply chains of the ICT equipment industry (USA_26) present  an 
interesting case, which is positioned  at the top -left corner of the diagram . The low 
concentration of its value -added origin in China may be a straightforward reflection of 
the US economy’s sheer size  as well as a classic offshoring practice  in which only low 
value -added segment s of supply chain s are transferred abroad . In contrast, the high 
position ing along the vertical axis indicates  the frequent exposure of  its supply chains  to 
the production networks with in China’s geographic territory , raising the likelihood of 
being caught by (natural or human -driven)  contingencies  in the country.  
Likewise, it is politically relevant to point out the high concentration of apparel 
and textile supply chains (13T15) in China , when the possibility of impr oper treatment 
of cotton field workers in the Xinjiang region is attracting worldwide attention.  
In general, the two metrics of network  concentration , in terms of volume and 
frequency,  seem to be positively correlated . However , the above case of the U S ICT 
 
8 In 2020, the US government successfully persuaded TSMC, the world’s dominant foundry of 
semiconductors from Chinese Taipei, to build a plant in the state of Arizona, while keeping the company 
away f rom its bilateral transaction with Huawei, a major Chinese mobile phone manufacturer.

 equipment  sector vis-à-vis China suggests that only considering the volume side may 
lead to  a significant underestimati on of  the overall risk  in supply chain management . 
 
[The US -China relations]  
Finally, Figure 3 presents the relative risk positions in the same setup as in 
Figure 2, applying the analysis to all supply chains of the United States and China , 
mutually targeting the other as a high -risk country. The issue of economic security is 
paramount in adversary relations  between these superpowers, and establishing  strategic 
autonomy from the opponent is on their critical policy agenda.  
The figure shows a dramatic development of the US -China bilateral production 
structure from 1995 to 2018. The United States became far mor e dependent on China in 
this period than the other way round.

 In 1995, the network concentration of the US supply chains vis -à-vis China was 
only visible in the apparel and textile products sector (USA_13T15). The sector is known 
as one of the oldest global manufacturing industries driven by firms’ offshoring activit ies 
to countries with a cheap labor force. By 2018, the US supply chain of every industry had 
significantly increased its concentration in China, both in terms of volume and pass -
through frequency. These changes are particularly evident in key manufacturin g sectors 
of national importance, such as ICT equipment (USA_26) and automotive (USA_29). 
Among the service sectors, telecommunications (USA_61) is highly dependent on China’s  
domestic production networks.  
The observed asymmetry in the dependenc e structure  between the two 
countries has a strong implication for the  feasibility of the current “decoupling” strategy 
by the US government, as suggested in the United States Executive Order on February 
24, 2021.9 High PTF indices of the US supply chains indicat e their profound engagement 
in the complex nexus of demand -supply relations centered on China’s production system, 
which is possibly enmeshed within the domain of “Factory Asia (Baldwin, 2008)”. 
Accordingly, it would be an extremely complicated exercise to i dentify who among the 
 
9 “Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains”: February 24, 2021.

americas -supply -chains/

 US allies are involved, in which production stages, and to what degree, making it difficult 
if not impossible to individually segregat e them from China’s influence along the supply 
chains.  
 
5. Some extensions  
This research can be developed and extended in several directions. What follows 
is not an exhaustive list of ideas but is intended to provide insight into its application 
possibility in areas of high policy relevance.  
 
(1) “Choke point map”  
In Table 1, we present a pair of PTF indices and TiVA for the respective supply 
chains, setting Japan and China as target regions. By performing the same calculation 
for all other countries covered in the multi -country input -output table, it is possible to 
identify a cho ke point for each supply chain by cross -country comparison of PTF/TiVA 
values. Such a  “choke point map” can be drawn in much higher resolution if the PTF is 
referred to in individual target -sector matrices  rather than the aggregate matrix, which 
enables us to define a choke point at the country -sectoral level.

 (2) Subregional analysis  
Natural hazards are generally associated with a specific area or sub -region of a 
country. M ore detailed and accurate  risk analys es will be possible if we use the 
information of the input -output table at the sub-national level. Several efforts have been 
made in the past to construct multi -country input -output tables with subregional 
extension s. For example, Inomata and Meng (2013) in troduced the transnational 
interregional input -output table for China, Japan, and Korea, constructed by the 
Institute of Developing Economies , JETRO , which links the interregional input -output 
tables of respective countries into a single matrix to account for regional heterogeneity 
within a country in a multi -country framework. The table allows for disaster impact 
analyses across national borders on a region -to-region basis, for example , between 
Tohoku in Japan and Huanan in China. See also Cherubini and Lo s (2013) for Italy, 
Dietzenbacher et al.  (2013) for Brazil, and Meng et al.  (2013) for China, which embed the 
respective country’s interregional input -output table in  the European Commission –
funded World Input -Output Database  (Timmer et al. 2015 ).

 6. Conclusion  
In this paper , we present ed and analyze d new referential statistics for the risk 
assessment of the network  concentration of global supply chains. The study’s net 
contribution rests on the development of a metric that  indicates concentration in terms 
of the frequency  of supply chain engagement with the regions of analytical concern, 
alongside the traditional approach based on volume measures of value -added 
concentration.   
Japan, a country with a high  propensity to encounter natural hazards , and China, 
under mounting geopolitical tension s with the U nited States , were chosen as the target 
regions fo r risk assessment. The analysis followed a line of techniques in input -output 
economics known as the “key sector analysis,” yet with methodological augmentation 
employing  a compatible analytical framework in network theory. Using the latest set of 
multi -country input -output tables constructed by the OECD, the following findings  were  
presented . 
The supply chains of the selected industrialized economies are generally more 
concentrated in China than in Japan. The study of China as a target region  reveals that 
the nature of concentration risks differs between advanced economies and emerging 
economies, such that the former is more prone to facing frequency risks than volume

36 
 risks, while the opposite is observed for the latter. For Japan as a target region, 
Taiwanese industr ies stand out for being dependent on the country, especially with 
regard to the share of value -added origins.  
Focusing on the ICT equipment industry, the supply chains of Korea and 
Chinese Taipei are most exposed to concentration r isks in China, both in terms of volume 
and frequency. In contrast, the US supply chains present an interesting case ; the low 
concentration of its value -added origin in China may be a straightforward reflection of 
the US economy’s sheer size, while its frequent exposure to China’s geographic territory  
is associated with the likelihood of being caught by contingencies in the country.  
In general, the two metrics of network concentration in the volume and 
frequency terms  were positively correlated. However, th e above US case suggests that 
only considering the volume side may lead to a significant underestimation of the overall 
risk in supply chain management.  
Finally , the analysis of mutual risk positions for the US and China’s supply 
chains reveal ed a notable asymmetry in the dependence structure between the two 
countries, posing a significant concern to US ’ strategic autonomy from China.

 Appendix  A    Multiple -counting of the Structural Betweenness Centrality  
 
Consider three -stage paths ( 𝑙 + 𝑚 = 3) for a three -sector input -output system  
(𝑠1,𝑠2,𝑠3). The total backward impact of unit production from sector  𝑠3 to sector  𝑠1 is 
calculated as  
(𝑨3)13 
= 𝑎11𝑎11𝑎13  (Path 1:  3→1→1→1)  
+ 𝑎12𝑎21𝑎13  (Path 2:  3→1→2→1)  
+ 𝑎13𝑎31𝑎13  (Path 3:  3→1→3→1)  
+ 𝑎11𝑎12𝑎23  (Path 4:  3→2→1→1)   
+ 𝑎12𝑎22𝑎23  (Path 5:  3→2→2→1)   
+ 𝑎13𝑎32𝑎23  (Path 6:  3→2→3→1)  
+  𝑎11𝑎13𝑎33  (Path 7:  3→3→1→1)  
+ 𝑎12𝑎23𝑎33  (Path 8:  3→3→2→1)  
+ 𝑎13𝑎33𝑎33  (Path 9:  3→3→3→1)  
 
Let 𝑠2 be the target sector. Among  the nine paths  above , we only have to 
consider those that go through  𝑠2 to calculate  the structural betweenness  centrality , as 
presented  in Figure A .10 The adjacent table  below the diagram  shows the decomposition 
of a respective impact propagation  into the downstream sequence (DS) and upstream 
sequence (US).  Note that Path 5 yields two different DS/US pairs, each corresponding to 
a different border anchored by 𝑠2.

10 The reason is as follows. By referring to Equation (10), it is seen that if a path does not go through 
target sector 𝑡, 𝑐(𝑡) is zero (0 ) by definition; hence, the value for the corresponding path also becomes 
zero.

 Now, Equation ( 9) can be expanded as follows.  
(𝑳−𝑰) 𝑱(𝒕)(𝑳−𝑰) 𝒚  
= (𝑨𝟏+𝑨𝟐+𝑨𝟑+⋯) 𝑱(𝒕)(𝑨𝟏+𝑨𝟐+𝑨𝟑+⋯)𝒚 
= (𝑨𝟏 𝑱(𝒕)+𝑨𝟐 𝑱(𝒕)+𝑨𝟑 𝑱(𝒕)+⋯)(𝑨𝟏+𝑨𝟐+𝑨𝟑+⋯)𝒚  
=  (𝑨𝟏 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟏+𝑨𝟐 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟏+𝑨𝟑 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟏+⋯  
  + 𝑨𝟏 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟐+𝑨𝟐 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟐+𝑨𝟑 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟐+⋯ 
  + 𝑨𝟏 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟑+𝑨𝟐 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟑+𝑨𝟑 𝑱(𝒕)𝑨𝟑+⋯)𝒚 
It can be seen that the impact 𝑎12𝑎22𝑎23𝑦3 along  Path 5, “ 3→2→2→1 ”, is 
captured  by the term 𝑨𝟐𝑱(𝑡)𝑨𝟏 𝒚 when taking the first emergence of 𝑠2 as a DS/US border , 
and it is also counted in 𝑨𝟏𝑱(𝑡)𝑨𝟐 𝒚 when taking the second 𝑠2 as a border ; that is , the 
equation double -count s the same amount of impact s when the target sector appears 
twice . Such multiple counting applies to any combination of downstream/upstream 
sequences for any higher -order propagation.  
 
 
Appendix B    Pass -through Frequency for a transaction  
 
Multiple -counting of identical impacts in accordance with the emergence of 
transaction (𝑡1,𝑡2) is formulated as  
[𝑎𝑡1𝑡2𝑳𝑱(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑳]
𝑠1𝑠𝑘 
=𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘+∑∑ ( 𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4…𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘)
𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3 
… (B-1) 
where 𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2) is the number of times the transaction (𝑡1,𝑡2) appears in a particular 
backward linkage path . Note that the first term of Equation ( B-1) corresponds to a 
linkage path 𝑠𝑘→𝑠1 of length 1 , whereas the second term corresponds to paths with a 
length of more than 2 . For the first term, i f 𝑠1=𝑡1 and 𝑠𝑘=𝑡2,  𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘=𝑎𝑡1𝑡2; 
otherwise, 𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘=0. The PTF for transaction (𝑡1,𝑡2) can then be formulated as  
𝑓(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑠1𝑠𝑘=[𝑎𝑡1𝑡2𝑳 𝑱(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑳 ]𝑠1𝑠𝑘
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘  
=𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘+∑∑( 𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘) 𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘 
=𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘+∑∑ (𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅ 𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘)
𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3 
… (B-2) 
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4314548
42 
 Analogous to the sectoral model, the transactional PTF is equivalent to a 
weighted average  of 𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2), an integer indicating the number of times the target 
transaction  (𝑡1,𝑡2) appears in a particular (𝑠1,𝑠𝑘) path , using impact shares as weig hts. 
Furthermore, let 𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘) be the total amount of impact propagations 
from 𝑠𝑘 to 𝑠1 such that transaction  (𝑡1,𝑡2) appears in (𝑠1,𝑠𝑘) path exactly 𝑟 times . Then , 
we have  
𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠𝑘+∑∑ ( 𝑐(𝑡1,𝑡2)⋅𝑎𝑠1𝑠2 𝑎𝑠2𝑠3 𝑎𝑠3𝑠4… 𝑎𝑠𝑘−1𝑠𝑘)
𝑠2,…,𝑠𝑘−1∞
𝑘=3 
= ∑𝑟⋅𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘) .∞
𝑟=0 
and 
[𝑳−𝑰]𝑠1𝑠𝑘=∑𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘) .∞
𝑟=0 
 
Accordingly, Equation ( B-2) can be reformulated as  
𝑓(𝑡1,𝑡2)𝑠1𝑠𝑘=∑𝑟⋅𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘)∞
𝑟=0
∑𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘)∞
𝑟=0=∑𝑟𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘)
∑𝜎(𝑟)(𝑠1,𝑡1,𝑡2,𝑠𝑘)∞
𝑟=0∞
𝑟=0 , 
… (B-3) 
which makes it easier to see that the PTF is indeed equivalent to a weighted average of 
𝑟 by the impact shares from 𝑠𝑘 to 𝑠1 for particular values of 𝑟. 
 
  
Appendix C   Impact decomposition by target transaction emergence: a case study on 
China’s “Computer, electronic and optical equipment” sector (CHN_26 x CHN_26)  
 
 Using the transactional PTF model  and the OECD’s Inter -Country Input -
Output Table (the 2021 release) , Figure C and Table C present the result of impact 
decomposition by the number of times that a target transaction appears on a supply 
chain. We chose the intra -sectoral transaction of China’s “Computer, electronic and 
optical equipment  (26)” secto r <CHN_26 x CHN_26> as the target transaction, and 
considered six supply chains connecting a final product producer of the “Motor vehicles, 
trailers and semi -trailers  (29)” sector in Germany , Japan and the United States,  on one 
hand, and a value -added sour ce in the “Computer, electronic and optical equipment  (26)” 
sector of Korea and Chinese Taipei , on the other.

A multi -country input -output table brings together national tables of different 
countries into a single framework and thus has the same basic structure as a national 
input -output table. The rows of the table show the supply sectors of products, the 
columns  represent demand sectors for products, and the intersection of a row and a 
column indicates the value of transaction exchanged between these two sectors. However, 
the distinctive feature of multi -country tables is that they explicitly present 
internationa l transactions in the form of import/export matrices by trading partners, 
which allows for a comprehensive mapping of global production networks.  
Figure D provides a schematic presentation of the table for a simplified example 
of three sectors ( Agricultur e, Manufacturing, and Service) and three countries (China, 
the United States, and the Rest of the World).

In the column -wise direction, entries in the table indicate the input 
compositions of the respective country’s industrial sectors. Entries in the ZCC, for 
example, show the input composition of China’s industries for domestically produced 
goods and service s, that is, domestic transactions with in China. By contrast , those in the 
ZUC show the input composition of China’s industries for imported products from the 
United States. The entries in ZWC allow the same interpretation vis -à-vis China’s imports 
from the  Rest of the World, that is, all other countries in the world  except China and the 
United States.  
Turning to the 10th and 11th columns from the left, the se present China’s final 
demand for goods and services. For example, the YCC, YUC, and YWC map China’s final 
demand for domestic products, imports from the United States, and imports from the 
Rest of the World, respectively. The remaining columns were read in the same manner.  
Vs and Xs are value -added and total output , respectively, as seen in the 
conventional national input -output table.  
 
The multi -country input -output system shown in Figure D can be presented in 
matrix form as follows:
