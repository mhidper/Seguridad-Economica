Abstract This paper employs a weighted network approach to study the
empirical properties of the web of trade relationships among world countries,
and its evolution over time. We show that most countries are characterized by
weak trade links; yet, there exists a group of countries featuring a large numberof strong relationships, thus hinting to a core-periphery structure. Also, better-
connected countries tend to trade with poorly-connected ones, but are also
involved in highly-interconnected trade clusters. Furthermore, rich countriesdisplay more intense trade links and are more clustered. Finally, all network
properties are remarkably stable across the years and do not depend on the
weighting procedure.

1 Introduction
This paper employs network analysis to study the statistical properties of the
web of trade relationships among a large set of world countries in the period
1981–2000. We use data on import and export ﬂows to build, in each year, anetwork of links between pairs of countries, where each link is weighted by
the amount of trade that it carries. This enables us to apply novel statistical
techniques developed in the framework of weighted network analysis and thusto characterize some robust stylized facts of international trade patterns.
In the last decades, a large body of empirical contributions have increasingly
studied socio-economic systems in the framework of network analysis.
1A
network is a mathematical description of the state of a system at a given
point in time in terms of nodes and links. The idea that real-world socio-
economic systems can be described as networks is not new in the academicliterature (Wasserman and Faust 1994 ). Indeed, sociologists and psychologists
have been employing social network analysis since the beginning of the last
century to explore the patterns of interactions established among people orgroups (Freeman 1996 ;S c o t t 2000 ).
2
More recently, however, the empirical study of networks has ﬂourished
thanks to the considerable contribution stemming from physics and computerscience. Scholars from such academic disciplines have begun to extensively
explore the statistical properties of technological, biological and information
networks with new and more powerful statistical tools (Albert and Barabási2002 ; Dorogovtsev and Mendes 2003 ; Newman 2003 ; Pastos-Satorras and
Vespignani 2004 ). Fields of application here include—among others—the
Internet and the WWW, peer-to-peer networks, power grids, train routesand airline connections, electronic circuits, neural networks, metabolism and
protein interactions, and so on.
These new methods have been subsequently applied to social and economic
systems (Watts 1999 ). As a result, the idea that systems like markets, industries,
or the world economy, might be considered as networked structures has be-
come increasingly accepted also among empirical economists. In this context,a network-based approach has been recently employed in empirical studies of
international trade (Serrano and Boguñá 2003 ;L ie ta l . 2003 ; Garlaschelli and
Loffredo 2004a ,2005 ; Kastelle et al. 2005 ; Serrano et al. 2007 ; Bhattacharya
et al. 2007a ,b). Here the idea is to depict the web of trade relations as
a network where countries play the role of nodes and a link describes the
presence of an import/export relation between any two countries (and possiblythe intensity of that ﬂow). We call this network the World Trade Web (WTW).
1A survey of this enormous literature is beyond the scope of this paper. The interested reader is
referred to Scott ( 2000 ), Barabási ( 2003 ), Watts ( 2003 ), Carrington et al. ( 2005 ), among others.
2Well-known examples of such studies include networks of friendship and social acquaintances
(Rapoport and Horvath 1961 ; Milgram 1967 ), marriages (Padgett and Ansell 1993 ), and job-
market interactions (Granovetter 1974 ).
The evolution of the world trade web: a weighted-network analysis 481
What can a network approach add to our economic understanding of
international trade dynamics? We claim that this methodology allows for abetter description of the existing heterogeneity in the degrees of connectivity
and, hence, of international economic integration. For example, total trade to
GDP ratios only provide a measure of openness of an economy, but fail tocapture the ways in which each country is connected within the WTW. This
subtler evidence can be instead fully evaluated by means of higher (than one)
order measures of connectivity, i.e. indicators that take into account traderelationships that are one, two or three steps away from the node/country
under analysis. In other words, what matters for integration into the WTW is
not only how much a country trades but also the speciﬁc distribution of tradevolumes across trading partners. Additionally, for a full picture of integration,
the speciﬁc characteristics of the trading patterns of every partner must also
be considered. These various dimensions of connectivity can be characterizedusing complex network indicators that measure the number and the intensity of
the trading relationships, the level of clustering (bilateral or multilateral trade),
their dispersion or concentration, the centrality for a given node (country).
The relevance of these speciﬁc characteristics from an economic perspective
emerges from the fact that trade relationships deﬁne a certain degree of
dependency of other countries on a given country, or a certain degree of in-ﬂuence of one country on others. For example, node (country) centrality,
discussed in detail later in the paper, denotes the likelihood of a given country
to appear along a randomly selected trade chain within the trade network. Thehigher this likelihood, the more inﬂuential the country is within the network
(or the more the network depends on this country). Hence, shocks hitting more
central countries are more likely to be transferred to many other countries.This idea of network dependency or network fragility can also be related to
the presence and size of trade blocks in the network. If trade blocks are well
deﬁned, then shocks originated in one block would not affect other blocks.Therefore it is important to look at the degree of clustering within the WTW.
Knowledge of such topological properties is not only important per se (e.g.,
because it enhances our descriptive knowledge of the stylized facts pertainingto the WTW, and allows us to give a more detailed account of the processes
of integration and globalization), but it may also be relevant to better explain
macroeconomic dynamics. As suggested by Kali and Reyes ( 2007 ) and Serrano
et al. ( 2007 ), a full description of the WTW can be used to highlight global
interdependencies that explain the propagation of ﬁnancial and economic
crises, since an economic slowdown of a given country can easily disruptproduction and consumption chains within the WTW. Indeed, as shown by
Forbes ( 2002 ) and Abeysinghe and Forbes ( 2005 ), economic shocks to any
single country can be easily transmitted—via trade linkages of any order andnon-linear multiplier effects—to countries that are relatively minor bilateral
trading parters. Alternatively, international trade ﬂows can also be seen as
cash ﬂows exchanges among the countries involved. Therefore a reductionof exports reduces the capabilities of a given node to import from other
countries. Finally, the arguments that have emerged from growth theory (see
482 G. Fagiolo et al.
for instance Rivera-Batiz and Romer 1991 ) linking the beneﬁts from trade to
the exposure to new technologies and the expansion of market access can beveriﬁed and fully characterized by using network analysis. Empirically, recent
studies have in fact suggested that gains from trade do not depend only on
the degree of trade openness, but also on the number of trading partners andtheir characteristics (Arora and Vamvakidis 2005 ). Also, Kali et al. ( 2007 ) ﬁnd
that a higher number of trading partners (which corresponds to node degree in
complex network analysis) is associated with higher growth rates and suggeststhat this is the result of exposure to better technologies, expanded market
access, and higher levels of competition.
In this paper, we present a detailed study of the WTW for the period 1981–
2000 using a weighted network approach (see also Fagiolo et al. 2009 ,f o r
complementary results). From a purely descriptive perspective, we attempt to
single out some robust stylized facts pertaining to trade relationships and theirevolution over time. The empirical regularities displayed by the data could
then be used as a starting point to model the structure and the evolution of
the WTW and therefore provide a theoretical explanation of why the networkof trade ﬂows is organized in this way. In other words, empirical regularities
can provide some guidance for theoretical models that seek to explain the
evolution of world trade linkages and the beneﬁts (and costs) arising fromthem. For example, the evolution of free trade agreements has been the
objective of recent theoretical studies that follow an endogenous network-
formation approach (Goyal and Joshi 2006 ; Furusawa and Konishi 2007 ).
3
Our ﬁndings indicate that countries with similar industrialization levels tend
to form trade blocks (clubs) in the WTW.
More speciﬁcally, this paper attempts to answer the following questions:
Are rich countries more connected than poor ones—both in terms of the
number and intensity of their trade relationships? Do well-connected countries
entertain trade relationships with partners that are themselves well-connected(i.e. hold many and intense trade relationships)? How large is the likelihood
that rich countries tend to trade with countries that preferentially trade only
among them? Or, in other words, how large is the probability to ﬁnd groups ofrich countries that form trade clusters? What are the most central countries in
the WTW? Have the structural properties of the WTW been changing across
time? Is the WTW more connected today than in the past (both in terms ofnumber of connections and trade ﬂows)? What has all that to do with the
would-be process of globalization?
From a methodological point of view, we employ novel techniques that
allow us to study the WTW as a weighted network.
4The bulk of the relevant
literature on international trade networks has indeed studied a binary version
3See Jackson ( 2004 ) for an introduction.
4The analysis of weighted networks was introduced in Barrat et al. ( 2004 ,2005 ), Barthélemy et al.
(2005 ), and further developed in Dall’Asta et al. ( 2006 ), Saramaki et al. ( 2007 ), Onnela et al.
(2005 ), DeMontis et al. ( 2005 ).
The evolution of the world trade web: a weighted-network analysis 483
of the WTW, where each directed link from country ito country jis either in
place or not according to whether the trade ﬂow from itojis larger than a
given threshold. On the contrary, we weight the importance of each directed
link by using actual trade ﬂows and GDPs.5A similar approach has been
adopted by Li et al. ( 2003 ), Bhattacharya et al. ( 2007b ), Bhattacharya et al.
(2007a ) and Serrano et al. ( 2007 ). In this paper, conversely, we build on Fagiolo
et al. ( 2008 ) and we present an analysis of the WTW which focuses on the
following dimensions. First, we present a description of WTW properties span-ning across several measures/indicators (e.g., node connectivity, assortativity,
clustering and centrality). Second, we look at how WTW properties correlate
with country/node characteristics such as country income (as measured by percapita GDP). Third, we study the extent to which empirical regularities are
robust to alternative ways of weighting existing links. Finally, we statistically
check whether the inherent directionality of WTW ﬂows is so strong to justifyan analysis that takes explicitly into account the direction of trade ﬂows or, by
contrast, one can safely study the WTW as if it were an undirected graph.
Some of the concepts used throughout the paper are not new to the
international trade literature, though they assume here a different connotation.
So, for instance, the network of international trade to which we refer, is not the
same developed in the works of Rauch and co-authors (see Rauch 2001 ;R a u c h
and Casella 2003 ), where the authors focus on the role played by business
and social networks in alleviating informational asymmetries. Here, on the
contrary, we exploit network analysis to describe the patterns of aggregategoods trade among countries. Similarly, core countries are not necessarily
those where most of productive activities are located as in the New Economic
Geography framework, bur rather those involved in a large number of tradelinkages (Ottaviano et al. 2002 ).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2we brieﬂy
introduce, in a rather informal way, the main concepts related to the empiricalanalysis of networks. Section 3brieﬂy surveys the relevant literature on
international trade networks. Data are described in Section 4. We report our
main results in Section 5. Finally, Section 6concludes and discusses future
work.
2 An introduction to the statistical analysis of weighted networks
A socio-economic network is usually described by means of a graph, that is a
collection of Nnodes, possibly connected by a set of links.
6
The simplest type of graph is binary and undirected. This means that any
two nodes can be either connected by a link or not, and link directions do not
count. If two nodes are connected, we say that they are “partners” or “nearest
5Cf. also Fagiolo et al. ( 2009 ), where links are weighted using trade ﬂows only.
6We refer the reader to Fagiolo et al. ( 2007 ) for more formal deﬁnitions and notation.

neighbors”. To formally characterize such type of networks, it is sufﬁcient to
provide the adjacency matrix, i.e. a symmetric N×Nbinary matrix Awhose
generic entry aij=aji=1if and only if a link between node iand jexists (and
zero otherwise).7
If the researcher has good reasons to justify her/his empirical analysis by
using binary undirected networks, the most immediate statistics is the node-
degree (ND) distribution (and its moments). ND is simply deﬁned as the
number of links that a given node has established (i.e., how many connectionsit holds). The shape of the ND distribution can convey a lot of information
on the structural properties of a network. For example, binary undirected
networks that are created totally at random have unimodal, bell-shaped NDdistributions.
8On the contrary, the scale-free networks (Barabási 2003 )a r e
characterized by right-skewed (power-law) distributions, with a majority of
small-ND nodes and a minority of large-ND nodes (i.e., the hubs).
If one is instead interested in a graph-wide measure of the degree of
connectivity of the network, a simple way to proceed is to compute the density
of the graph. The latter is deﬁned as the total number of links that are actuallyin place divided by the maximum number of links that there can exist in an
undirected graph with Nnodes.
The ND statistic only counts nodes that are directly linked with the one
under analysis. In this respect, it can be considered as a ﬁrst-order indicator,
as it only takes into account information about nodes that are one step-away
from the original one. However, any two nodes with the same ND can acquire adifferent importance in the network to the extent their partners are themselves
connected in the network, i.e. if they also have a high ND. To measure how
much the partners of node iare themselves very connected in the network,
one may compute the average nearest-neighbor degree (ANND), that is the
average of ND of all partners of i. Nodes with the largest degree and ANND
are typically the ones holding the most intense interaction relationships.
A third important feature of network structure concerns the extent to
which a given node is clustered, that is how much the partners of a node
are themselves partners.
9This property can be measured by the clustering
coefﬁcient (Watts and Strogatz 1998 ; Szabó et al. 2005 ), that is the percentage
of pairs of i’s nearest neighbors that are themselves partners. Node clustering
7Self-loops, i.e. links connecting iwith itself are not typically considered. This means that aii=0,
for all i.
8For example in random networks where each link is in place with a certain given probability,
independently on all the others (i.e., according the simplest Erdös-Renyi random-graph model:
see e.g. Bollobás 1985 ). In what follows, we employ the term “random network” as a synonym for
the Erdös-Renyi random-graph model.
9Network clustering is a well-known concept in sociology, where notions such as “cliques” and
“transitive triads” have been widely employed (Wasserman and Faust 1994 ;S c o t t 2000 ). For
example, friendship networks are typically highly clustered (i.e. they display high cliquishness)because any two friends of a person are very likely to be friends.
The evolution of the world trade web: a weighted-network analysis 485
is very important, as geographically-structured networks are typically highly-
clustered, with short-distance links counting more than long-distance ones.Unlike ND, ANND and node clustering are both second-order indicators,
because they look at statistics concerning nodes lying two steps away from the
one under consideration.
So far, we have only considered binary networks, i.e. graphs where what
counts is the mere presence or absence of an interaction between any two
nodes. Many researchers have argued, however, that the majority of socio-economic relationships also involve an assessment of how intense is an interac-
tion between two nodes (if any). If one studies such relationships using a binary
undirected network approach, it is likely that a lot of important informationwill be disregarded (see Barrat et al. 2004 , for an introduction). Conversely,
in many other networks like the internet, airline trafﬁc, scientiﬁc citations,
or the WTW, links are characterized by a non-reducible heterogeneity. If weuse a binary undirected network analysis, we run the risk of considering the
same way links that instead carry very weak or very strong ﬂows. In those
cases, we need to move from a binary undirected network perspective to aweighted (undirected) network approach. A weighted undirected network is
simply deﬁned by means of a symmetric N×N“weight” matrix W, whose
generic entry w
ij=wji>0measures the intensity of the interaction between
the two nodes (and it is zero if no link exists between iand j).
The three statistics above (degree, ANND, and clustering) can be easily
extended to a weighted undirected network approach. First, ND can bereplaced by node strength (NS), deﬁned as the sum of weights associated to
the links held by any given node. The larger the NS of a node, the higher
the intensity of interactions mediated by that node. It is easy to see that,given the same ND, any two nodes can be associated to very different NS
levels. Incidentally, we note that strength is only an aggregate measure of
the interaction intensity mediated by a node. Thus one can also measure theextent to which a node holds links associated with a very dispersed (resp.
concentrated) weight proﬁle. To do that, each node ican be associated with
the Herﬁndahl strength-concentration index.
10The index will be equal to one
if a country concentrates all its trade relationships with one partner, and it will
decreases towards zero the more differentiated is its trade portfolio (for any
given number of trade partners).
Second, one might assess how much the partners of a node are themselves
characterized by a high strength by computing either the weighted average of
nearest-neighbor node degrees (WANND, see Barthélemy et al. 2005 )o rt h e
arithmetic average of nearest-neighbor strengths (ANNS). Once again, any two
nodes with the same ANNS (and ANND) can end up having very different
levels of ANNS or WANND.
10See Herﬁndahl ( 1959 ) and Hirschman ( 1964 ). For early applications of the disparity index to
networks, see Almaas et al. ( 2004 ) and Barthélemy et al. ( 2005 ).
486 G. Fagiolo et al.
Third, one can straightforwardly compute a weighted clustering coefﬁcient
by suitably weighting the edges of each triangle. The resulting clustering co-efﬁcient will read:
˜C
i(W)=1
2∑
j̸=i∑
h̸=(i,j)w1
3
ijw1
3
ihw1

jh

2di(di−1), (1)
where wijare the weights associated to links and diis the degree of node i(see
Onnela et al. 2005 ; Saramaki et al. 2007 ; Fagiolo 2007 ).
Another important notion in network analysis concerns the extent to which
a given node is “central” in the graph. However, the meaning of “centralityof a node” is rather vague and has consequently generated many competing
concepts and indicators (Scott 2000 ). The two most commonly employed
deﬁnitions of centrality refer to a local notion (a node is central if it has alarge number of connections) or to a global notion (a node is central if it
has a position of strategic signiﬁcance in the overall structure of the network).
Local centrality can be easily measured by node degree (in binary undirectednetworks) or node strength (in weighted undirected networks). As far as
global centrality in binary undirected networks is concerned, the most used
indicator is node betweenness centrality (BC), deﬁned as the proportion of all
shortest paths between any two nodes that pass through a given node. BC thus
measures how much a given node acts as intermediary or gatekeeper in the
network. It is easy to see that low-ND nodes, which are not locally central, canhave a large BC, and therefore be globally central.
Despite its importance, BC is not straightforwardly extendable to weighted
undirected networks. Therefore, in this paper, we build on recent works byNewman ( 2005 ) and Fisher and Vega-Redondo ( 2006 ), who have put forward
a notion of centrality that nicely ﬁts both binary undirected network and
weighted undirected network analyses. In a nutshell, they develop an indexcalled random walk betweenness centrality (RWBC), which easily captures
the effects of the magnitude of the relationships that each node has with its
partners as well as the degree of the node in question. Newman ( 2005 )o f f e r s
an intuitive explanation of this centrality measure. Assume that a source node
sends a message to a target node. The message is transmitted initially to a
neighboring node and then the message follows a link from that vertex, chosenrandomly, and continues in a similar fashion until it reaches the target node.
The probabilities assigned to outgoing links can be either all equal (as in
binary undirected networks) or can depend on the intensity of the relationship(i.e., link weights in weighted undirected networks), so that links representing
stronger ties will be chosen with higher probability. In this respect, RWBC—
being a global centrality indicator—is a highest-order indicator, as it embodiesinformation about across-node paths of any length.
Finally, notice that the “undirected” nature of both binary undirected
networks and weighted undirected networks approaches requires the matrices
Aand Wto be symmetric. This implies that it is reasonable to assume that
binary or weighted relationships are bilateral or reciprocal. However, the
The evolution of the world trade web: a weighted-network analysis 487
majority of interaction relationships that can be captured in network analyses
are in principle directed (i.e., not necessary symmetric or reciprocal). Forexample, exports from country ito country jin a given year (e.g., as a share
ofi’s GDP) can be substantially higher or lower than exports from country
jto country i(e.g., as a share of j’s GDP). As discussed in Fagiolo ( 2006 ),
deciding whether one should treat the observed network as directed or not is
an empirical issue. The point is that if the network is “sufﬁciently” directed,
one has to apply statistics that take into account not only the binary/weighteddimension, but also the direction of ﬂows. As this analysis can often become
more convoluted, one ought to decide whether the “amount of directedness”
of the observed network justiﬁes the use of a more complicated machinery.There can be several ways to empirically assess if the observed network is
sufﬁciently symmetric or not (cf. Garlaschelli and Loffredo 2004b ; Fagiolo
2006 ). In many cases, networks that can be thought to be asymmetric turn
out to appear sufﬁciently symmetric to justify a binary/weighted undirected
network approach (see also below for the WTW). If this happens, the common
practice is to symmetrize the original observed network.

3 Related literature
The idea that international trade ﬂows among countries can be conceptualized
by means of a network has been originally put forth in sociology and political
sciences. Those studies however have a different aims from the present work,since they mainly focus in testing some ﬂavor of “world system” or “depen-
dency” theory. According to the latter, one can distinguish between core and
peripheral countries: the former would appropriate most of the surplus valueadded produced by the latter, which are thus prevented from developing.
Network analysis is then used to validate this polarized structure of exchanges.
For example, Snyder and Kick ( 1979 ) study the binary undirected network
stemming from aggregate data on trade relationships among 118 countries in
1965 and employ a core-periphery setup to classify countries in three groups
(core, semi-core, and periphery). They obtain a clear-cut three-tiered structurefor the network, with core countries nearly identiﬁed with OECD members.
Regression analyses show that the position of a country in the network is
able to explain GNP growth, a result interpreted as a sort of conﬁrmationof dependency theories. The importance of network position in explaining
growth and development from a core-periphery approach is also stressed by
Nemeth and Smith ( 1985 ), who apply their analysis to 1970 data of trade
ﬂows disaggregated over 5 distinct product classes.
12A similar approach is

12Sacks et al. ( 2001 ) build a measure of country position in the network based on the concept of
“structural autonomy” and show that it has a positive effect on country’s per capita GDP.
488 G. Fagiolo et al.
followed by Breiger ( 1981 ), who studies the composition of trade ﬂows in 1972.
Notably, he shows that country classiﬁcation into blocks is not robust to theintroduction of weighted links: if one employs a weighted undirected network,
where link weights are deﬁned as total trade ﬂows (depurated by average
imports and exports for that product class in order to account for size effects),two competing blocks emerge. The ﬁrst one is dominated by the US (and
comprises Canada and Japan), while the second accounts for the (then young
and small) European Community. More recently, Smith and White ( 1992 )
explore in a dynamic framework the core-periphery approach to network
analysis by comparing results in three different years (1965, 1970 and 1980).
They document an enlargement of the core over time, a reduction of within-core variability, and a progressive marginalization of very peripheral countries.
A binary, directed approach is instead followed by Kim and Shin ( 2002 ),
who study three snapshots of trade ﬂows (1959, 1975 and 1996) disaggregatedover a large set of commodities for 105 countries. Interestingly, they ﬁnd that
both the density of the network and the variance of ND distributions have
increased through time, a result which is associated by the two authors to theglobalization process. Moreover, the creation of new links does not appear to
be evenly distributed. Core countries are more likely to create outward links
(i.e., to initiate an export link), while peripheral countries are more likely tocreate an inward link (i.e., to receive it), with Asian countries accounting for
the majority of newly created links.
13The effects of globalization are further
explored by Kastelle et al. ( 2005 ) who perform a binary network analysis
on IMF data to test baseline hypotheses on the dynamics of the topological
properties of the WTW. They study the period 1938–2003 and ﬁnd that the
evolution of the international trade network has not reached any steadystate implying a fully-globalized pattern. Rather, the WTW has been slowly
changing and seems to have the potential to continue to do so in the future.
The study of international trade as a relational network has been recently
revived in the ﬁeld of econophysics, where a number of contributions have
explored the (notionally) complex nature of the WTW. The common goal
of these studies—well in line with the strategy described in Section 2—
is to empirically analyze the mechanics of the international trade network
and its topological properties, by abstracting from any social and economic
causal relationships that might underlie them (i.e., a sort of quest for theory-free stylized facts). Our analysis adopts many of the tools developed in this
literature, but makes a further step by attaching an economic interpretation to
the relevant topological properties.
From a methodological perspective, the majority of contributions carry out
their analysis using a binary approach. In other words, a link is either present
or not according to whether the trade ﬂow that it carries is larger than a given
13Very similar results are obtained by Mahutga ( 2006 ), who shows that the globalization process
has induced structural heterogeneity and thus inequality.

lower threshold.14For instance, Serrano and Boguñá ( 2003 ) and Garlaschelli
and Loffredo ( 2004a ) study the WTW using binary undirected and directed
graphs. They show that the WTW is characterized by a disassortative pattern:
countries with many trade partners (i.e., high NDs) are on average connected
with countries with few partners (i.e., low ANNDs). Furthermore, partnersof well connected countries are less interconnected than those of poorly
connected ones, implying some hierarchical arrangements. In other words, a
negative correlation emerges between CC and ND distributions. Remarkably,Garlaschelli and Loffredo ( 2005 ) show that this evidence is quite stable over
time. This casts some doubts on whether economic integration (globalization)
has really increased in the last 20 years. Furthermore, the ND distributionappears to be very skewed. This implies the coexistence of few countries with
many partners and many countries with only a few partners.
More recently, a few contributions have adopted a weighted-network ap-
proach to the study of the WTW. The motivation is that a binary approach
cannot fully extract the wealth of information about the intensity of the
trade relationship carried by each edge and therefore might dramaticallyunderestimate the role of heterogeneity in trade linkages. This seems indeed
to be the case: Fagiolo et al. ( 2008 ,2009 ) show that the statistical properties of
the WTW viewed as a weighted undirected network crucially differ from thoseexhibited by its weighted counterpart. For example, the strength distribution
is highly left-skewed, indicating that a few intense trade connections co-exist
with a majority of low-intensity ones. This conﬁrms the results obtained byBhattacharya et al. ( 2007a ,b), who ﬁnd that the size of the group of countries
controlling half of the world’s trade has decreased in the last decade. Serrano
et al. ( 2007 ) study the network of bilateral trade imbalances.
15They note
that also the international trade-imbalance network is characterized by a high
level of heterogeneity: for each country, the proﬁle of trade ﬂows is unevenly
distributed across partners. At the network level, this prompts to the presenceof high-ﬂux backbones, i.e. sparse subnetworks of connected trade ﬂuxes
carrying most of the total ﬂux in the network.
A common problem of all these studies is that the directed or undirected na-
ture of the observed international-trade networks is not thoroughly addressed.
14There is no agreement whatsoever on the way this threshold should be chosen. For example,
Kim and Shin ( 2002 ) use cutoff values of US$ 1 million and 10 million. Kastelle et al. ( 2005 )
endogenously set a cutoff so as to have, in each year, a connected graph. Kali and Reyes ( 2009 )
experiment with different lower thresholds deﬁned as shares of country’s total exports. On the
contrary, other papers (Serrano and Boguñá 2003 ; Garlaschelli and Loffredo 2004a ,2005 ;K a l i
and Reyes 2007 ) straightforwardly deﬁne a link whenever a non-zero trade ﬂow occurs.
15That is, they weight each link by the difference between exports and imports. Notice that, as
happens also in Bhattacharya et al. ( 2007a ,b), their across-year comparison may be biased by
the fact that trade ﬂows are expressed in current U.S. dollars and do not appear to be properlydeﬂated.
490 G. Fagiolo et al.
In other words, a directed (or undirected) analysis is pursued without statis-
tically assessing the underlying observed nature of the WTW. An exceptionis the paper by Garlaschelli and Loffredo ( 2005 ), who explore the conditions
under which one can recover the directed character of a network from its
undirected description. However, they fall short from providing a directedanalysis using ad-hoc indicators (see for example Fagiolo 2007 ).
4 Methodology and data
We employ international trade data provided by Gleditsch ( 2002 ) to build
a sequence of weighted directed networks from 1981 to 2000. Original data
report imports and exports from/to a large set of world countries for theperiod 1950–2000. The choice of the subperiod to be used in the study is
driven by three related considerations. First, data for small countries suffer
from many missing values, both on trade ﬂow and GDP/population. Second,the number of countries for which trade data are available increases over the
years. This might be a problem if one wants to analyze the dynamics of the
topological properties of the WTW. Third, the country sample size must be aslarge as possible to achieve statistical signiﬁcance. As a result, we decided to
build a balanced panel by focussing on T=20years (1981–2000) and N=159
countries (see Appendix B for more details).
For each country and year, data report trade ﬂows in current US dollars.
Therefore, we have deﬂated all nominal ﬁgures so as to allow for meaningful
across-year comparisons. Whenever exports from country itojdo not match
imports of jfrom i, we averaged the two ﬁgures. To build adjacency and
weight matrices, we followed the ﬂow of goods. This means that rows represent
exporting countries, whereas columns stand for importing countries.
As to link weighting, in order to avoid any ambiguity stemming from the
choice of a particular lower threshold, we deﬁne a “trade relationship” by
setting the generic entry of the adjacency (binary) matrix ˜a
t
ij=1if and only if
exports from country ito country j(labeled by et
ij) are strictly positive in year
t. Moreover, we experiment with a few economically-meaningful weighting
systems and explore the robustness of our results to these alternatives. Ourbaseline results will refer to weights deﬁned as ˜w

ij/GDPt
i,w h e r e et

time- t(deﬂated) exports from country ito country j,a n d GDPt
iisi’s real gross
domestic product in year t. This weighting procedure allows us to control for
exporter country’s size and tells us how economy idepends on economy jas
a buyer (as jis buying from i). Furthermore, we check if our results change
when we divide et
ijby the importing country’s output ( GDPt
i). This can provide
information on how economy jdepends on economy ias a seller. Finally, we
study what happens when we do not scale exports by GDPs and we just weight
a link from itojwith exports et
ij.
For any particular choice of the weighting setup, we end up with a sequence
ofN×Nadjacency and weight matrices {˜At,˜Wt},t=1981,...,2000 ,w h i c h

fully describe the evolution of the WTW from a binary and weighted directed
perspective.
5R e s u l t s
5.1 Global properties of the WTW
We begin with a quick overview of the main global properties of the WTW.
From a binary perspective, the WTW appears to be a highly connected
network, with an extremely high density, which has been slightly increasingover the years (cf. Fig. 1). This witnesses for the increasing participation of
countries to world trade over the last 20 years of the last century. It is easy to
see that the majority of links are reciprocated: for instance, in the second halfof the 1990, almost all countries export to partners that in turn export to them.
The almost-symmetric pattern of the WTW is statistically detected also by
the Sindex studied in Fagiolo ( 2006 ), which for all years stays very close
to zero for both the binary and the weighted version of the WTW, thus

strongly testifying in favor of symmetry.16If anything, the WTW seems to
have become more symmetric during the years. This evidence indicates thata directed analysis is not necessary. Therefore, in what follows, we will explore
the statistical properties of symmetrized versions of the WTW. This means
that, in the binary case, any entry a
ijof the new adjacency matrix Ais set to
1 if and only if either ˜aij=1or˜aji=1(and zero otherwise). Accordingly, the
generic entry of the new weight matrix W, originally deﬁned as ˜wt

is replaced by:17

In order to have well-behaved weights, we also employ the convention of
dividing all entries in Wby their maximum value. This does not introduce any
bias in our analysis and ensures that wt
ij∈[0,1]for all (i,j)andt(Onnela et al.
2005 ).
5.2 Connectivity
The ﬁrst issue we address concerns the study of the shape of the degree
and strength distributions. More speciﬁcally, we explore the extent to whichcountries are more or less connected (i.e., if they are more or less locally-
central in the WTW) both in terms of number of partners (ND) and interaction
intensity (NS), and whether these patterns have changed through time.
To begin with, we note that ND distributions do not appear to be as skewed
as expected (see Fig. 2). In fact, they can hardly be proxied by lognormal or
Pareto densities. A power-law behavior is detected only in the middle of thedistribution, as the sharp cutoff reported by Garlaschelli and Loffredo ( 2005 )
is present. Remarkably, ND distributions display some bimodality: beside a
modal value of 50–100 partners, there is a large group of countries that tradewith almost everyone else (hence a second peak around 150). This evidence
is more pronounced in the middle of the period. Note also that the shape
of the ND distribution remains quite stable over time. Figure 3displays the
time evolution of the ﬁrst four moments of the ND distribution: average
ND has slightly increased over the years, meaning that the number of trade
relationships have been weakly but steadily growing during the observed timeframe. Moreover, the standard deviation has remained stable, which suggests
that integration has increased rather evenly, without resulting in any rise in the
16See Fagiolo et al. ( 2007 ) for technical details. Note that the corresponding standardized index
takes values at least 10 standard deviations below zero.
17Due to the extreme symmetry of the network, results do not change if one symmetrizes the
export matrix ﬁrst and then divides by the GDP of the exporting country.

heterogeneity of the number of trade links established by each country. This
conclusion is reinforced by the reduction in both skewness and kurtosis thatcharacterizes the last few years in the sample: the ND distribution has thus
become more symmetric and the tails have thinned out to signify that fewer
countries now display extreme ND values.
The picture substantially changes when we measure connectivity in the
weighted version of the network. The distribution of NS among countries is
now much more lognormal, see Fig. 4, even though in the right tail (high
strengths) there seems to be many more countries than a lognormal model
would predict. Furthermore, bimodality disappears: strength distributions are

more right-skewed, with the majority of countries characterized by weak trade
relationships.
The structural difference between degree and strength distributions can be
better appreciated by looking at how the degree-strength correlation variesthrough time. As Fig. 5(left) shows, this correlation is signiﬁcantly larger
than zero and quite stable around 0.5. This means that on average countries
with many trade partners tend to hold also more intense trade relationships.However, as shown by the degree-strength scatter plot for 2000, the strength
variability for any given degree level is quite high (Fig. 5, right). This implies

that only a subset of those countries holding many trade relationships (high
ND) actually have a very high strength.18
Notice also that the weak increase in ND is not matched by a similar
behavior for average NS, which remains quite stable in the period 1981–2000
(Fig. 6, left panel). Interestingly, average strength is relatively low (at least in a
[0,1] scale) as compared to the relatively high average degree. Furthermore,the observed drop of skewness and kurtosis of ND distributions does not
have a counterpart as far as NS is concerned (compare Figs. 3and 6,r i g h t
panels). Since this phenomenon is mainly concentrated in the 1990s, it seems tosuggest that the recent wave of globalization resulted in an increased number
of connections, but did not have any sizable effect on their magnitude. In terms
of NS there are many more countries in the tails of the distribution, which isalso much more skewed than in the case of ND.
Right-skewness of NS distributions maps into a relatively high average
node disparity (i.e., a relatively low Herﬁndahl index). Indeed, a majority ofcountries holding a portfolio of very dispersed trade relationships typically
coexists with a few countries that concentrate almost all their trade ﬂows within
a small numbers of partners. Node disparity distributions can in fact be verywell approximated by log-normal densities. It is interesting to note that in
general node disparity is negatively correlated with both node degree and node
strength. Therefore, the more partners a country holds, and the more intenseits trade relationships, the more dispersed is its trade proﬁle. This is partially
expected, because in the presence of equally-distributed weights node disparity
should scale as the inverse of node degree.
18As the right panel of Fig. 5shows, there seems to be a subset of countries featuring low ND and
relatively high strength.
496 G. Fagiolo et al.
This ﬁrst set of results allows us to make an important methodological point.
If the study of the WTW is carried out from a binary undirected networkperspective, thus loosing a lot of information, one runs the risk of getting a
misleading picture of the underlying relational patterns. A weighted network
perspective, instead, allows one to better appreciate how the intensity of theinteraction structure is distributed across the population (cf. also Fagiolo et al.
2008 ).
5.3 Assortativity
The foregoing results suggest that the WTW, if viewed as a binary undirected
network, is a relatively strongly connected and dense network. On the con-
trary, if we give weights to these trade links, the picture changes completely:the WTW, now viewed as a weighted undirected network, is characterized
by a majority of relatively weak trade ﬂows coexisting with a few strong
trade connections.
19This reﬂects results reported in Serrano et al. ( 2007 )
and, interestingly, reminds of the distinction between intensive and extensive
margins found in the microeconomic trade literature, with the former (export
intensity) being much more important than the latter (number of exportingﬁrms) in explaining aggregate export performances.
Degree and strength statistics, however, are only ﬁrst-order indicators. In
other words, they just take into account links to one-step-away partners anddo not convey any information on the ﬁner structure of the WTW. Indeed, it
may well happen that countries holding many links only trade with poorly-
connected countries or that the latter link themselves to the hubs of thenetwork (we call such a network “disassortative”). Conversely, it may be
the case that better connected countries also tend to trade with other well-
connected countries (i.e., an “assortative” network).
In order to explore assortativity in the WTW, let us begin with a binary
undirected network perspective and study the behavior of average nearest-
neighbor degree (ANND), and how it correlates with other network statistics.As expected, ANND is very high and quite stable in the period considered
(Fig. 7, left). Average ANND weakly increases from 110 to 120 and stays
always above the average degree. However, the degree-ANND correlationpattern clearly indicates a strongly disassortative network: correlation ﬁgures
are very close to −1 and their magnitude increases over time (Fig. 7,r i g h t ) .
In the WTW viewed as a binary undirected network, countries that hold manytrade relationships deﬁnitely trade with poorly-connected countries, which in
turn may exploit their hub status. This results conﬁrms previous ﬁndings by
Serrano and Boguñá ( 2003 ) and Garlaschelli and Loffredo ( 2004a ).
If the WTW is now studied as a weighted undirected network, its dis-
assortative nature remains evident but results are much weaker. As Fig. 8
19As discussed in Section 5.7, this holds true even if one replaces the baseline weighting procedure
with a few, economically meaningful, alternative schemes.

shows, population-averages of both weighted average nearest-neighbor degree
(WANND) and average nearest-neighbor strength (ANNS) are quite stable
over time and mimic the behavior of degree and strength. However, their
correlation with degree and strength is still negative but weaker in magnitudein all years (Fig. 9). This means that countries holding a lot of (or very strong)
trade relationships do not tend to establish very intense trade links with all
their partners. Again, the study of the WTW from a weighted undirectednetwork perspective is able to offer a different (and more insightful) picture.
The disassortative nature of the WTW implies that countries that are less
(and more weakly) connected tend to form trade relationships with well andmore intensively connected countries (i.e., the hubs). This feature is relevant,
since it suggests that the WTW has a core-periphery structure (at least in terms
of link intensity). This feature, which is common in many social and economicnetworks, ﬁnds theoretical backing in a recent model by Hojman and Szeidl

(2008 ), where the authors prove that under fairly general assumptions, the
unique equilibrium network has a star-like structure.20From an economic and
policy point of view, this results is likely to imply that peripheral countries
suffer from a sort of marginalization. Consistently with some recent results inthe ﬁeld of economic geography (see Ottaviano et al. 2002 , p. 411), we interpret
our ﬁnding as suggesting that such a polarized structure is not necessarily the
most efﬁcient outcome, and that a more balanced structure of trade relationswould allow both developing and industrialized countries to exploit more
completely the gains from trade.
To further investigate this feature, we plot correlation patterns of ANND,
WANND and ANNS vs. node degree and strength. As Fig. 10shows for
year 2000, the ANND-ND correlation presents a very limited variability. Con-
versely, both the WANND-ND and the ANNS-NS scatter plots are character-ized by a much more dispersed cloud of points. In particular, there seems to
exist a not negligible number of medium/high-degree or medium/high-strength
countries that, despite the overall disassortativity, tend to trade with countriesthat are themselves more and better connected. This seems to support the
hypothesis that, within the core-periphery structure of the WTW, there exists
an intermediate periphery that is well connected to high degrees nodes (andtrades heavily with them).
5.4 Clustering
We now turn to exploring clustering patterns, and their relations with connec-
tivity. This entails asking whether more and better connected countries tend
20The key assumptions are that the beneﬁts from connections exhibit decreasing returns, and that
they depend negatively on distance. Contrary to the predictions of the model, the WTW does not
display a single country as its center. This is due to the fact that in the (real) world of international
trade, the beneﬁt from connecting to a country is not monotonically increasing in the number ofits trading partners. This sufﬁces for a network to display more that one hub.

to build trade relationships with pairs of countries that themselves trade with
each other.
Figure 11(top-left) shows the behavior of the average CC for the binary
undirected network description of the WTW. Average CC is very high in
all years. Furthermore, it is always larger than network density (cf. Fig. 1).
Since in a random network the expected CC is equal to its density, this resultimplies that the WTW (viewed as a binary undirected network) is statistically
more clustered than if it were random. Therefore, countries tend to form—
on average—trade relationships with partners that also trade with each other.This sort of “cliquishness” suggests that regional or local ties still play a
very relevant role, where localism does not not necessarily have a geographic
meaning, but can very well be read as a tendency to interact with traditionalpartners.
21These can be members of a regional group, countries with similar
degree of development, or simply partners that are historically close.
Does this result hold also when we take into account that trade relationships
are very heterogeneous in their intensity? The answer is no.22What is more,
the supports of node-clustering distributions lies, in every year, to the left of
random-network expected values, indicating that no country ever exhibits aclustering coefﬁcient that is above the expected value.
Yet, the comparison with random networks may not be very meaningful in
the weighted case. In fact, we already know that link weights and strengths arefar from being uniformly-distributed across existing links. Therefore, a fairer
comparison requires the computation of the expected clustering coefﬁcient
across all weighted networks that are characterized by the same (observed)network density and the same (observed) links, but by a random allocation
21This interpretation is further corroborated by the fact that geographically-structured networks
are typically highly clustered, with short-distance links counting more than long-distance ones.
22Indeed, the weighted version of the CC, albeit quite stable over time, is signiﬁcantly smaller
(from a statistical point of view) than its expected value in a random network. Indeed, average
clustering ranges from 3.8776×10−4(in 1994) to 5.5106×10−4(in 1982) whereas the expected
value of weighted clustering in random networks goes in the same years from 0.2272 to 0.2717—that is,

of the (observed) weights across the existing links.23As Fig. 11(top-right)
shows, this comparison indicates that, on average, the weighted version of the
WTW is slightly less clustered than expected. Nevertheless, the across-node
distribution of clustering coefﬁcients is (in every year) quite skewed to theleft, as the bottom-left panel of Fig. 11shows for the year 2000. Thus, even
if on average the WTW is weakly clustered, a small portion of countries are
characterized by “excess” clustering, i.e. a clustering larger than its expectedvalue in networks with the same binary structure and weight distribution. As
Fig.11(bottom-right) shows, this percentage oscillates around 25%, suggesting
that only a small fraction of countries are actually clustered. Out of the networkjargon, there seems to exist a strong heterogeneity in the way countries form
23To do so, for each year we generated a sample of 10000 random networks whose adjacency
matrices have been kept ﬁxed and equal to the observed one, whereas observed link weights have
been randomly reshufﬂed across the links.

and maintain trade cliques, consistently with the idea of the existence of a
minority of prominent nodes acting as strongly clustered hubs.
If one looks at the correlation between clustering and degree/strength,
the striking mismatch between binary undirected networks and weighted
undirected networks noticed above still emerges. Indeed, as found also bySerrano and Boguñá ( 2003 ) and Garlaschelli and Loffredo ( 2005 ), countries
that hold more trade partners (high degree) are less clustered than those
holding few partners. The correlation is very strong and negative, as it isclose to −0.96throughout the whole period (Fig. 12, left panels). From a
binary undirected network perspective, thus, a core-periphery, star-shaped
trade network seems to be in place. Countries that hold a small number oftrade relationships do not trade with each other but are connected to the
hubs. Again, if one takes into account the actual trade intensities associated
to these connections, the conclusion is reversed (Fig. 12, right panels). The
correlation between the weighted CC and strength is now positive, statistically-
signiﬁcant, and sharply increasing across time. Therefore, countries with high-
intensity trade relationships are typically involved in highly-interconnected

triples, that is clustering levels that are statistically larger than their expected
value in comparable random structures. This is a pattern that somewhatreminds the “rich club phenomenon” (where “richness” is now interpreted in
terms of intensity of trade relationships). The fact the the magnitude of the
CC-strength correlation is increasing through time suggests that the “rich clubphenomenon” continues to be an issue for international trade. This ﬁnding
is consistent with a recent model by Furusawa and Konishi ( 2007 ) where the
authors ﬁnd that—if countries are asymmetric and industrial commodities areindependent from each other—pairs of countries sign a trade agreement only
if their industrialization levels are similar.
The above “rich club phenomenon” result is also in line with what van
der Leij and Goyal ( 2006 ) call “strength of strong ties”: a core-periphery
structure, with strong ties being located in the core. In this context, strong
connections (rather than weak ones as postulated by Granovetter 1974 )a r e
crucial for bridging different parts of the graph. This feature can be seen as
another way to express the idea that networks are robust but fragile. In fact,
removing one of the peripheral nodes generates no particular problems tothe stability of the system. On the contrary, a shock hitting the core will be
quickly transmitted to the whole network and can therefore trigger a systemic
crisis. Hence, the structure of the trade network can explain why economicupturns and downturns have often a regional dimension, while shocks hitting
key players tend to have a global impact.
5.5 WTW properties and country-speciﬁc characteristics
An interesting issue to explore concerns the extent to which country speciﬁc
characteristics relate to network properties. In fact, we expect not only the
former to determine the latter, as usually claimed in the international tradeliterature (Baier and Bergstrand 2004 ), but also the position of each country
within the WTW to shape economic dynamics (Kali et al. 2007 ). We focus here
on the correlation patterns between network indicators and country per capitaGDP (pcGDP) in order to see whether countries with a higher income are
more integrated into world trade or more clustered.
As far as degree and strength are concerned, the outcomes are very clear:
there seems to be a relatively high and persistent positive correlation between
connectivity levels and pcGDP (Fig. 13), both in terms of the number of trade
partners a country holds and in terms of the intensity of its trade interactions.However, the strength-pcGDP correlation appears to be stronger than the
degree-pcGDP one.
24Therefore, high-income countries tend to hold more,
and more intense, trade relationships.
24Also the shape of the underlying relation is different. While degree seems to be linearly
related to pcGDP, a log-log relation holds between strength and pcGDP. This means that pcGDPinﬂuences more heavily node strength than node degree.

Results for clustering-pcGDP correlations mimic instead those obtained for
the correlation between clustering and degree/strength. High-income coun-
tries tend to be less clustered from a binary undirected network point of
view, while they are more clustered (and increasingly so over the years)from a weighted perspective (Fig. 14). This result supports the “rich club
phenomenon” interpretation discussed above. The fact that this correlation is
increasing over the years suggests that cliquishness among richer countries hasbeen augmenting so that, as long as the strength of trade relations is concerned,
further integration for the overall network can be attributed to stronger ties
among advanced countries.
5.6 Centrality
So far we have treated nodes as if they were anonymous, not considering
which countries display higher or lower network properties. Now we address

the role each country plays in the WTW by means of a measure of global
centrality . By doing so, we will be able to explicitly characterize the core and
the periphery of the network, whose existence is hinted at by our results, and to
compare them.
We compute random walk betweenness centrality (RWBC) for each of the
countries in the sample and use the results to classify them as part of the
core and or of the periphery. It turns out that—due to the high density thatcharacterizes the WTW—the binary version of RWBC is almost perfectly
correlated with ND:
25as a result, in what follows we will focus only on the
weighted version of RWBC. A second reason to look at weighted RWBC onlyis that so far weighted indicators seemed to give a better representation of the
network structure, and in particular to hint more directly to a core-periphery
structure.
RWBC is the highest order measure of integration considered in this study,
since it takes into consideration paths of any given length that go through the
country under analysis. In other words it measures the likelihood of a givencountry appearing in a randomly selected trade chain within the network. This
likelihood is determined by the number and intensity of trading relationships,
those of country iand those of all other countries. Therefore more central
countries are more inﬂuential because they have a higher number of direct
connections, which are also characterized by high intensity.
Figure 15presents the distribution of weighted RWBC for 1981, 1990, and
2000. The observed patterns have not changed over time and the distributions
are heavily skewed to the right, conﬁrming the hypothesis of a clear-cut core-
periphery structure. To identify the countries actually belonging to the corewe (arbitrarily) impose a threshold at the 95th percentile of RWBC: hence,
only countries with a value of centrality within the top 5% are considered
25The correlation between the two indicators is not statistically different from 1.

aUp to 1989 data refers to West Germany only
core.26Table 1displays the 8 countries forming the core between 1981 and
2000. Interestingly, this simple information turns out to be very powerful
in describing the evolution of international trade integration in the last two
decades of the XXth century, and can actually trace a number of relevanteconomic episodes. For instance, uniﬁcation allows Germany to overcome
Japan in this special ranking and gain the second place, whereas the dissolution
of Soviet Union marked the exit from the core, as Russia (which took itsplace in the sample) never comes close to reaching the ﬁrst 5% of the sample.
Moreover, the 1981 peak in oil prices that followed the second shock and the
beginning of the Iran–Iraq war results in Saudi Arabia being brieﬂy includedinto the core, though it drops quickly out of it and further away in the following
years as the price of crude oil drops down.
More recently, the increasing importance acquired by Asian countries—
most notably China, but also South Korea—in international trade is captured
by our centrality index. Both countries have become part of the core in 2000,
after having been close to achieve this already in 1995. Other Asian countriessuch as Malaysia, India and (above all) Thailand have experienced a remark-
able increase in their RWBC over the last twenty years. On the contrary,
Latin American countries (i.e., another classical group of emerging markets)did not manage to climb the ranking as fast as their Asian counterparts. For
instance, Brazil displays a very stable measure of centrality, whereas Mexico
and Argentina are characterized by wide ﬂuctuations both in the absolutevalue of the RWBC index and in the relative position in the ranking. Among
Latin American countries only Chile and, to a lesser extent, Colombia do
appear to improve their status within the WTW network, although they haveremained quite peripheral. Qualitatively, the picture does not change if we let
the data “choose” core countries. This can be done by ranking them in terms of
RWBC and re-deﬁne the core as the set of countries commanding at least 50%of world trade. The outcome is very similar to the previous one and suggests
26A very similar result is obtained if one attributes the core status to those countries displaying
values of RWBC above the mean plus one standard deviation.

the presence of a small (and stable) number of countries playing a pivotal role
in the WTW.
Finally, the analysis of the correlation between per capita GDP and RWBC
reveals a similar pattern to that observed for the relationship between node
strength and pcGDP.27
5.7 Robustness
All results obtained so far refer to a particular weighting procedure. To recall,
each directed link from node itojis weighted by total exports of country ito
country jand then divided by the country i’s GDP (i.e., the exporter country).
Such a weighting setup allows one to measure how much economy idepends
on economy jas a buyer.
Are our ﬁndings robust to alternative weighting schemes? To address this
issue, we consider the two alternative setups discussed in Section 4.I nt h eﬁ r s t
setup, we still remove size effects from trade ﬂows, but we now divide by the
GDP of the importer country ( j’s GDP, in the above example). In the second
setup, we retain the size effect and we simply deﬁne the weight of link (i,j)as
total exports from itoj.
All our main results turn out to be quite robust to all these alternatives.28
This is an important point, as a weighted network analysis might in principle
be sensitive to the particular choice of the weighting procedure.
To begin with, we compare the symmetry index for the three weighting
schemes across the years. If one scales exports by the importer’s GDP thesymmetry index stays very close to the one found in the baseline weighting
schemes, whereas if one does not scales by the GDP the index is surpris-
ingly lower, indicating that raw trade matrices are even more symmetricthat rescaled ones.
29This indicates that under all three schemes a weighted
undirected network analysis is appropriate.
As a further illustration, Fig. 16reports the correlation structure between
ANNS, clustering, node strength and pcGDP across years.30Left panels refer
to the ﬁrst alternative weighting scheme (exports scaled by importer GDP)
whereas right panels shows what happens under the second alternative setup(no GDP scaling at all). All previous results are conﬁrmed. Notice that if
we do not scale exports, an even stronger correlation emerges in all years
27This is expected since one of the interpretations of node strength is related to the degree of
inﬂuence that a given node has on the network or to what extent other nodes depend on a given
node; also, the correlation between RWBC and NS is very high.
28As mentioned, we have also experimented with another weighting scheme where we have
symmetrized the graph before dividing by exporter (or importer) GDP. All these alternatives did
not result in any signiﬁcant change of our main ﬁndings.
29This counter-intuitive result depends on the fact that the index computed controls for magnitude
effects. Therefore, GDP scaling may enhance differences between imports and exports rather than
balancing them.

results to hold irrespective of anyweighting scheme to be adopted. In fact, the
binary undirected network characterization of the WTW is itself a particular
weighting scheme, one that assigns to each existing link the same weight.31
31In this respect, an interesting exercise would imply to ﬁnd (if any) a proper rescaling or
manipulation of original trade ﬂows that makes weighted and binary undirected network resultslooking the same.

6 Concluding remarks
In this paper, we have explored the empirical properties of the world trade
web (WTW) using network analysis. This allows us to better characterize the
degree of international trade integration and to track its evolution over time.Following a stream of recent literature, we have conceptualized the web of
trade relationships across countries as a weighted network where countries
play the role of nodes, and trade ﬂows represents links between nodes. Tothat end, we have studied imports/exports ﬂows between all pairs formed out
of 159 countries, from 1981 to 2000.
From a methodological point of view, we address a thorough empirical
investigation of the statistical properties of the WTW as a weighted network.
This means that instead of accounting for the mere presence of a trade
relationship between any two countries, we estimate the intensity of anytrade relationship by some function of the value of trade ﬂows carried by
that link. Our results show that a weighted analysis can deliver a different
insight as far as the topological structure and statistical properties of theWTW are concerned. Indeed, many ﬁndings obtained by only looking at
the number of trade relationships that any country maintains are completely
reversed if one takes into account the relative intensity of trade links. Fur-thermore, our main (qualitative) ﬁndings seem to be quite robust to a number
of alternative, economically meaningful, weighting schemes (cf. also Fagiolo
et al. 2009 ).
From a descriptive point of view, this paper can be considered as an
attempt to single out some robust stylized facts pertaining to the evolution of
the WTW structure. As compared to standard international-trade statisticalinvestigations, network analysis allows the researcher to explore not only ﬁrst-
order phenomena associated to import-export patterns of any given country
(e.g., the degree of openness to trade) but also second- and higher-orderempirical facts concerning, for example, the extent to which highly connected
countries tend to trade with poorly connected ones, the likelihood that trade
partners of highly connected countries are themselves parters, and so on. Inthis respect, this study can be considered as a preliminary step towards a
modeling exercise that attempts to replicate and explain the statistical reg-
ularities that we empirically observe (e.g. in the framework of endogenous-network formation models à la Jackson 2004 ).
Our exercises show that the WTW is an extremely symmetric network,
where almost all trade relationships tend to be reciprocated with similarintensities. This allows one to study the WTW as if it were a weighted
undirected network. Notwithstanding a very high density, the average strength
of nodes is rather poor. Indeed the majority of countries holds mainly weakrelationships, whereas only a selected core on nodes combine high degree
and high strength. This hints to a core-periphery structure for the weighted
WTW. This insight is conﬁrmed by the ﬁnding regarding the “disassortative”
The evolution of the world trade web: a weighted-network analysis 509
nature of the WTW: our data show that countries holding many (and
more intense) trade relationships preferably trade with poorly-connectedcountries.
From a policy perspective the polarized structure of international trade is
sub-optimal. From a standard Ricardian point of view it prevents all countriesto fully exploit the beneﬁts of comparative advantages and factor endowments.
Similarly, if one takes an approach closer to endogenous growth theory and
assumes that the main beneﬁt from trade comes from the ﬂows of ideas andfrom market size, it is clear that occupying a peripheral place in the WTW can
hinder growth and development.
Furthermore, while the average number of trade relationships has increased
through time, their average intensity has remained quite stable. More gen-
erally, all structural properties of the WTW display a remarkable station-
arity across the years. This stability implies that trade integration has notincreased dramatically over the last 20 years or, in other words, that its
change has not had a signiﬁcant impact on the structure of the WTW. A
possible explanation is that trade integration has been steadily growing sincethe 1950s and the bulk of it had been achieved before the period under
consideration here. This means that the recent wave of globalization has not
altered signiﬁcantly the structure of the WTW, though one observes countriessuch as China and India rapidly gaining ground in terms of centrality in the
network.
We also ﬁnd that the WTW, viewed as a binary undirected network, is highly
clustered. Moreover, countries that hold more trade partners (high degree)
are less clustered than those holding few partners. These conclusions are
completely different when we account for the importance of each link. Indeed,the weighted version of the WTW displays a relatively weaker clustering level
and (the few) countries with high-intensity trade relationships are typically
involved in highly-interconnected trade triples. Hence, there exists a smallgroup of tightly connected countries that play a pivotal role in the network
of world trade.
Finally, we have studied the relationships between network properties and
country income. We have shown that high-income countries tend to form more
(and more intense) trade links and to be more clustered (and increasingly so
over the years).
As mentioned, this work represents a preliminary step towards a better
understanding of the topological properties of the WTW and its dynamics.
The agenda of interesting issues to address in the future is therefore quite rich.Firstly, one would like to explore in more details the topological properties of
the WTW, both cross-sectionally and time-series. Meaningful questions here
concern the role of geographical proximity in shaping the structure of inter-national trade, the degree of fragility of the network, and so on. Furthermore,
trade ﬂows could be disaggregated across product classes to explore how trade
composition affects network properties.
510 G. Fagiolo et al.
Secondly, one could abstract from aggregate statistical properties and an-
alyze at a ﬁner level the role of single countries (or groups thereof) in thenetwork structure. For instance, how does the dynamics of degree, strength,
clustering, etc. behave for single relevant countries in different World regions?
Do country-speciﬁc network indicators display the same time-stationarity oftheir aggregate counterparts?
Another interesting exercise might involve checking the robustness of our
results when some of the most important nodes are removed. Similarly, onemay think of removing or aggregating countries belonging to trade agreements
or international communities (Europe, NAFTA, etc.). This may help one in
assessing how much the network topology for the sub-network of countriesthat are already integrated according to some trade or political agreements
differ from those of the whole WTW, or from those of the network of countries
that do not conform to those agreements.
Finally, to dig deeper in the policy implications outlined here, and in line
with work like Kali and Reyes ( 2007 ), one can ask whether the topological
properties of the WTW, viewed as a weighted network, are able to explain themacroeconomic dynamics of growth and development.

Appendix A: Countries in the balanced panel (1981–2000)
The dataset provided by Gleditsch ( 2002 ) includes 196 countries for which
there are data on trade ﬂows from 1948 to 2000. However, trade data contain
many missing (or badly reported) values before 1970. In addition, there aresome countries with zero total exports in some years.
Notice also that our analysis requires to match trade data with real GDP
(both in levels and per capita). This is because: (i) weights are deﬁned asexports divided by GDP; (ii) one wants to cross-sectionally correlate network
measures with country-speciﬁc variables like per-capita GDP.
We have therefore selected countries in such a way to have: (i) a time
horizon and a country sample size as long as possible; (ii) no missing values in
trade data and GDP (both in levels and per capita); (iii) non-zero total exports.
By applying conditions (i) and (ii) we get only 83 countries from 1960–2000.
This number becomes 138 for the period 1970–2000; 152 for the period 1970–
2000; 163 for the period 1981–2000; and 168 for the period 1990–2000. We thus
decided to select the time interval 1981-2000 using 163 countries. However,4 of them (San Marino, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco) have total exports
equal to zero in some years. This leaves us with N =159countries, whose list
is in Table 2.
