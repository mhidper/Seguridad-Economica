Abstract
Production systems, traditionally analyzed as almost independent national systems, are
increasingly connected on a global scale. Only recently becoming available, the WorldInput-Output Database (WIOD) is one of the first efforts to construct the global multi-regionalinput-output (GMRIO) tables. By viewing the world input-output system as an interdepen-dent network where the nodes are the individual industries in different economies and the
edges are the monetary goods flows between industries, we analyze respectively the
global, regional, and local network properties of the so-called world input-output network(WION) and document its evolution over time. At global level, we find that the industries arehighly but asymmetrically connected, which implies that micro shocks can lead to macrofluctuations. At regional level, we find that the world production is still operated nationally orat most regionally as the communities detected are either individual economies or geo-graphically well defined regions. Finally, at local level, for each industry we compare the net-work-based measures with the traditional methods of backward linkages. We find that thenetwork-based measures such as PageRank centrality and community coreness measurecan give valuable insights into identifying the key industries.
Introduction
Ever since Leontief [ 1] formalized its structure, the input-output table has been used exten-
sively by economists, environmentalists, and policy makers alike. By keeping track of the inter-industrial relationships, the input-output table offers a reasonably accurate measurement of
the response of any given economy in the face of external shocks or policy interventions. As
the global economy becomes increasingly integrated, an isolated view based on the nationalinput-output table is no longer sufficient to assess an individual economy ’s strength and weak-
ness, not to mention finding solutions to global challenges such as climate change and financial
crises. Hence, a global multi-regional input-output (GMRIO) framework is needed to draw a
high-resolution representation of the global economy [
2]. In practice, however, due to the
expensive process of collecting data and the variety of classifications used by different agencies,
for a long time, the input-output tables have only been available for a limited number of coun-
tries and for discontinuous years. Fortunately, the fully-fledged GMRIO databases started to

become available in recent years. Tukker and Dietzenbacher [ 3] have summarized the recent
development of the GMRIO databases.
Unlike the national input-output table where exports and imports are aggregated and
appended to final demand and country-specific value added respectively, for each individualeconomy, the GMRIO table splits its exports into intermediate use and final use in every for-
eign economy and also traces its imports back to the industry origins in every foreign economy.
As a result, the inter-industrial relationships in the GMRIO table are recorded not only withinthe same economy but also across economies.
The availability of the GMRIO databases was soon followed by a wave of empirical studies
of topics ranging from global value chains and trade fragmentation in economics [
4–7]t o
global environmental accounting in ecology and resources management [ 8–10]. However, to
the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first attempt to systematically explore the GMRIO
tables from a network perspective. In contrast, some previous studies only consider the input-output network at the national level [
11–13] while others only investigate a limited number of
countries or years of the GMRIO tables with simplified network methods [ 14,15].
Complex networks can be used to characterize a series of different systems where multiple
agents (nodes) interact with each other through their relationships (edges) [ 16,17]. This
approach has provided new insights in understanding complex phenomena in various fields
ranging from biology [ 18] to economics [ 19–21] and finance [ 22]. From a network perspective,
we consider the GMRIO system as a world input-output network (WION), where the nodesare the individual industries in different economies and the edges are the monetary goods
flows between industries. The direction of the flows goes from the seller industry to the buyer
industry. They are monetary because they are denoted in current US dollars. In a broad sense,our work is related to the fast-growing literature of the international trade networks, where
countries are represented by nodes and trade relationships are represented by edges [
23–31].
However, there are two key differences between the WION and the trade networks. First, theWION is based on industries. Not only the cross-country industrial relationships, but also thedomestic ones can be studied. Second, the WION focuses on intermediate transactions (i.e.,
products used for further production) while the trade networks aggregate both final (i.e., prod-
ucts used by final consumers) and intermediate trade flows. As the international trade isincreasingly characterized by intermediate transactions and hence by global value chains [
32],
the WION certainly becomes a more appropriate methodology than the trade networks to
study the world production system and the comparative advantages among countries andindustries.
As a specific network, the WION has the following features: 1) It is directed and weighted,
i.e., an industry can act as both a seller and a buyer at the same time and the monetary goodsflows between industries vary considerably in volume; 2) It is much denser within the same
economy than across economies, i.e., despite the continuously integrated global economy,
most economic transactions still happen within the country border. In contrast, due to thelow-digit industry classification, the input-output networks at the national level are typicallydense and complete [
11]; 3) It is with strong self-loops, i.e., an industry can acquire a signifi-
cant amount of inputs from itself, which is again due to the aggregated industry classification.
Taking into account the features above, we explore the WION by analyzing its global,
regional, and local network properties respectively. This paper makes some significant contri-
butions to the literature of input-output economics. First, unlike Carvalho [ 14] who uses only a
single-year (2006) GMRIO table and considers it as an unweighted network, we quantify theglobal network properties of the WION over time and take into account its edge weights and
directedness. We find that the increasingly integrated production chains tend to make the
WION more clustered and more assortative. We also find that the industries are both highly

connected, as captured by the degree distribution, and asymmetrically connected, as captured
by the strength distribution, which implies that local shocks can propagate through the world
economy and lead to a sizable global fluctuation. Second, at regional level, we study its sub-graph structure and dynamics by using community detection techniques. We find that theworld production is still operated nationally or at most regionally as the communities detected
are either individual economies or geographically well defined regions. In particular, we detect
the emergence of a large European community led by Germany, which is most likely the resultof the production activities outsourced in recent years from Germany to Central and Eastern
European countries with lower labor costs and growing demand. Finally, we quantify some
local network properties of the WION and compare them with the traditional methods ofbackward linkages. We find that the network-based measures such as PageRank centrality and
community coreness measure can give valuable insights into identifying the key industries.
The rest of the paper is structured as two sections. The following section first describes how
we construct the WION and then studies its network properties at global, regional, and local
levels respectively. The last section discusses some policy implications of our results and con-
cludes the paper.
Methods and Results
Construction of the WION
Our construction of the WION is based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) [ 33].
At the time of writing, the WIOD input-output tables cover 35 industries for each of the 40
economies (27 EU countries and 13 major economies in other regions) plus the rest of the
world (RoW) and the years from 1995 to 2011 ( S1 Table andS2 Table have the lists of countries
and industries covered in the WIOD.). For each year, there is a harmonized global level input-
output table recording the input-output relationships between any pair of industries in any
pair of economies. The relationship can also be an industry to itself and within the same econ-omy. The numbers in the WIOD are in current basic (producers ’) prices and are expressed in
millions of US dollars.
Table 1 shows an example of a GMRIO table with two economies and
two industries. The 4 × 4 inter-industry table is called the transactions matrix and is often
Table 1. A hypothetical two-economy-two-industry GMRIO table. The 4 × 4 inter-industry transactions matrix records outputs selling in its rows and inputs
buying in its columns. The additional columns are the final demand and the additional row is the value added. Finally, the last column and the last row re cord
the total industry outputs. The numbers are made up in such a way that Economy 2 is much larger than Economy 1 in terms of industry outputs. However, as
shown below, the Rasmussen method of backward linkages will consider industries in Economy 1 more important than the ones in Economy 2. Hence, we
use the Laumas method of backward linkages instead to identify the key industries in the WIOD.

denoted by Z. The rows of Zrecord the distributions of the industry outputs throughout the
two economies while the columns of Zrecord the composition of inputs required by each
industry. Notice that in this example all the industries buy inputs from themselves, which is
often observed in real data. Besides intermediate industry use, the remaining outputs areabsorbed by the additional columns of final demand, which includes household consumption,government expenditure, and so forth (Here we only show the aggregated final demand for the
two economies). Similarly, production necessitates not only inter-industry transactions but
also labor, management, depreciation of capital, and taxes, which are summarized as the addi-tional row of value added. The final demand matrix is often denoted by Fand the value added
vector is often denoted by v. Finally, the last row and the last column record the total industry
outputs and its vector is denoted by x.
As mentioned above, the complex networks approach has been widely used in economics
and finance in recent years. Designed to keep track of the inter-industrial relationships, the
input-output system is an ideal test bed for network science. Particularly the GMRIO systemcan be viewed as an interdependent complex network, i.e., the WION, where the nodes are theindividual industries in different economies and the edges are the flows between industries.
Fig 1 provides a topological view of Table 1 . The blue nodes are the individual industries.
The red nodes are the value added sources from the two economies, whereas the green nodesare the final demand destinations in the two economies. The edges are with arrows indicating
the directions of the monetary goods flows (Strictly speaking, the flows from the red nodes to
the blue nodes are not goods but primary inputs in nature.) and with varying widths indicatingthe magnitudes of the flows. Finally, because we are only concerned with the inter-industrial

are the value added sources from the two economies, whereas the green nodes are the final demand

label “Fx”should read “Final Demand in Economy x ”. The edges are with arrows indicating the directions of
the monetary goods flows and with varying widths indicating the magnitudes of the flows. Finally, because weare only concerned with the inter-industrial input-output relationships, when formulating the WION, we focus
our attention on the network among the blue nodes.

input-output relationships, when formulating the WION, we focus our attention on the net-
work among the blue nodes. In other words, we construct the WION using Zas its weighted
adjacency matrix.
The filtered version of the constructed WION in 1995 (Panel (A)) and 2011 (Panel (B)) are
shown in Fig 2 . Each node represents a certain industry in a certain economy. The size of the
node is proportional to its total degree. The edges are directed and only those with strength
greater than one billion US dollars are present. Finally, different colors represent different
economies. Clearly the WION has become denser over time and some countries like Chinahave moved to the core of the network.
In the following subsections, we quantify the network properties of the WION at global,
regional, and local levels respectively and document its evolution over time.
Global Analysis of the WION
The global network properties we quantify for the WION include assortativity, clustering coef-ficient, and degree and strength distributions. Because the WION is directed, we can calculatethe assortativity coefficient in three ways, namely, in-degree assortativity, out-degree assorta-
tivity, and total-degree assortativity. As shown in Panel (A) of
Fig 3 , they all behave similarly
over time. First, they have all been negative throughout the whole period. Since assortativitymeasures the tendencies of nodes to connect with other nodes that have similar (or dissimilar)degrees as themselves, a negative coefficient means that dissimilar nodes are more likely to be
connected. In the case of the WION, all the coefficients are of very small magnitude less than
0.06, but with statistical significance as shown in Panel (B) of
Fig 3 . Notice that when calculat-
ing the assortativity for in-degree, out-degree, and total-degree, respectively, we consider the
nodes as the neighbors of a given node if they are connected with the given node by only
incoming edges, by only outgoing edges, and by either incoming or outgoing edges,
Fig 2. The WION in 1995 and 2011. Each node represents a certain industry in a certain economy. The size of the node is proportional to its total degree
(number of edges). The edges are directed and only those with strength greater than 1000 millions of US dollars are present. Finally, different colors
represent different economies.

respectively. In contrast, Carvalho [ 14] defines the neighborhood solely on the basis of the
incoming edges and finds a positive assortative relationship. One possible explanation of the
negativity is that high-degree industries such as construction often take inputs (or supply out-
puts) from (or to) low-degree industries such as transport services. Moreover, the spatial con-straints (each node has only few neighboring nodes in the same country) introduce degree-degree anticorrelations (disassortativity) since high degree sectors are in different countries
and the probability to connect decays with distance [
34]. Second, all the coefficients show an
increasing trend before 2007 and a significant decline after 2007. The behavior of the assorta-tivity measures seems to be correlated with the trend of the foreign share in the inter-industrial
transactions over time (
Fig 4 ). That is, we can calculate the foreign share of the intermediate
transactions as the percentage of inputs from foreign origins (or equivalently, the percentage ofoutputs to foreign destinations) of the transactions matrix Zof the 40 WIOD economies. Same
as observed in assortativity, the foreign share of Zhas a steady growth (from 9.9% in 1995 to
12.8% in 2007) before 2007 and a sharp decrease after 2007 (While the most severely depresseddomestic edges during 2008 –2009 in terms of the magnitude of the reduced flows are mostly
within USA, the top 3 most impacted foreign edges are all from the mining industry to the
coke and fuel industry and are from Canada to USA, from Netherlands to Belgium, and from
Mexico to USA, respectively.). The increase in the foreign share implies more interactionsacross economies and hence tends to make the WION less dissortative. The opposite happens
when the foreign share goes down as a result of the global financial crisis. Third, we notice that
the in-degree assortativity tends to be lower than the out-degree assortativity, but there is a ten-dency to close the gap between the two measures. We interpret this evidence as a clear signal of
the integration of production chains, that is to say, both global buying and selling hubs have
now a higher chance to be connected across borders.
The hump-shaped behavior is also observed in the clustering coefficient. Panel (A) of
Fig 5
shows that the average weighted clustering coefficient of the WION has been steadily increas-
ing but was followed by a decline since 2007. Again, a possible explanation is that the boomingeconomy before 2007 introduced more interactions between industries, hence higher clusteringcoefficient, and the financial crisis after 2007 stifled the excessive relationships. Panel (B)
Fig 3. Assortativity of the WION over time. In Panel (A), from top to bottom, we show the over time out-degree assortativity, in-degree assortativity, and
total-degree assortativity, respectively. Panel (B) compares the total-degree assortativity calculated from the original WION with that calcula ted from its
random counterpart which preserves the degree distribution of the original network. For each year the random counterpart is simulated for 50 times an d the
95% confidence interval is shown. Therefore, even with small magnitude, the assortativity coefficients are nevertheless statistically significa nt.

same hump-shaped behavior over time is observed here as in assortativity and clustering coefficient.

explained by the foreign clustering coefficient.

further decomposes the clustering coefficient into domestic clustering coefficient and foreign
clustering coefficient. Clearly the behavior in Panel (A) is more explained by the foreign clus-
tering coefficient, which implies that the increasingly integrated production chains tend to
make the WION more clustered.
We can also examine the global network properties of the WION by plotting its degree and
strength distributions. Recall that the WION is based on the weighted adjacency matrix Z, i.e.,
the transactions matrix of the GMRIO table. Therefore, the degree and strength measures are
different from the direct and total linkages used in the conventional input-output analysis,which are based on the technical coefficients matrix Aand the Leontief inverse Lrespectively
(see Subsection “Local Analysis of the WION ”for the definitions). If we denote the regular
binary adjacency matrix as D, where D
ij=Dji= 1 if either Zij>0o rZji>0, then we have the
following definitions for a given node i: 1) In-degree: Din

As shown in Fig 6 , unlike other network systems such as the internet, where the degree dis-
tributions follow the power law, the WION is characterized by the highly left-skewed degree
distributions. Most nodes enjoy high-degree connections in the WION because the industries
are highly aggregated. Furthermore, the WION is almost complete, i.e., every node is connectedwith almost every node, if represented by unweighted edges. The same feature is also found in
the input-output networks at the national level [
12]. Using a single-year (2006) GMRIO table,
Carvalho [ 14] also reports the heavy-tailed but non-power-law degree distributions.
We further take into account the edge weights and examine the strength distributions of the
WION. Fig 7 shows the in-strength, out-strength, and total-strength distributions for the years

selected years 1995, 2003, and 2011, the first row has the in-degree distributions while the second row and
the third row have the out-degree and total-degree distributions respectively. The WION is characterized by
the highly left-skewed degree distributions. Most nodes enjoy high-degree connections in the WION due to
the aggregated industry classification.

1995, 2003, and 2011. We perform Gabaix-Ibragimov test [ 35,36] to see if the tails of the distri-
butions are Pareto but find no significant power-law tails. Moreover, like the previous studies
at the national level [ 12], the strength distributions can be well approximated by the log-nor-
mal distributions.
Our finding that the industries are both highly connected, as captured by the degree distri-
bution, and asymmetrically connected, as captured by the strength distribution, implies that
the local idiosyncratic shocks are possible to propagate through the world economy and gener-
ate a sizable global disturbance, as Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar and Tahbaz-Salehi [ 37]
argue that the asymmetric and fat-tailed distribution of the input-output network connections
serves as the micro origin of the macro economic fluctuations. The fact that the industrial con-
nections are increasingly globalized also calls for greater coordination and cooperation amongnational policy makers.
Regional Analysis of the WION
We next explore the regional network properties of the WION by conducting community detec-tion. A network may be partitioned into different communities, with many edges connectingnodes in the same community and few connecting nodes between different ones [
38]. If the
WION is completely globalized, i.e., any pair of industries in the world has an equal chance to be
connected, we should not expect any significant community structure to be detected. In the fol-
lowing we use the modularity optimization method introduced by Newman and Girvan [ 39]. It
is based on the idea that a random graph is not expected to have a community structure. There-
fore, the possible existence of communities is revealed by the comparison between the actual den-
sity of edges in a subgraph and the expected density if the nodes are attached randomly. The

distributions while the second row and the third row have the out-strength and total-strength distributions
respectively. The observed data are in black circles while the green curve is the fitted log-normal distribution.

expected edge density depends on the chosen null model, i.e., a copy of the original graph keeping
some of its structural properties but without community structure [ 38].
The most popular null model, introduced by Newman and Girvan [ 39], keeps the degree
sequence and consists of a randomized version of the original graph, where edges are rewiredat random, under the constraint that the expected degree of each node matches the degree ofthe node in the original graph.
The modularity function to be optimized is, then, defined as:

Figs8,9, and 10report the community detection results for the selected years 1995, 2003,
and 2011, respectively (We perform the community detection for all available years (1995 –
2011). Results are available upon request.). The 40 countries in the WIOD are arranged byrows while the 35 industries are arranged by columns. Different colors indicate different com-
munities detected. There are two interesting findings in our results. First, most communities
were based on a single economy, i.e., the same color often goes through a single row. This ech-oes one of the features of the WION mentioned in Section 1, i.e., most of the inter-industrial
activities are still restricted within the country border. Second, for all the three years selected,
we always color the community involving Germany in red and put it on the top. As a result,Fig 8. Community detection and community core detection results in 1995. The economies are arranged by rows and the industries are arranged by

our algorithm captures a growing Germany-centered input-output community. It is centered
on Germany because the community core detection results below show that the cores of this
red community are all within Germany. Since the WIOD monetary goods flows are based onundeflated current prices, one possible reason for the emergence of the German community isthat the community members may have experienced significantly more inflation and/or
exchange rate volatility than other regions in the world. Referring to the World Bank inflation
data and the exchange rate data used in the WIOD, we show that this is hardly the case (see
S1 Fig ).
From the above figures, it is straightforward to see that the WION is far from completely
globalized. Instead, the world production is still operated nationally or at most regionally as thecommunities detected are either individual economies or geographically well defined regions.
The detection of the emergence of the European community led by Germany is most likely the
result of the production activities outsourced in recent years from Germany to Central andEastern European countries with lower labor costs and growing demand. Another integrated
community detected is in North America, which is undoubtedly fostered by the regional trade
agreement, NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). However, since many Asianeconomies are not included in the WIOD, we cannot argue if a similar trend is ongoing in theFar East. Our finding that the integration of production chains is still by and large regional
implies that the governance of the global production system can be practically implemented at
regional level.
Within each community, we also carry out the community core detection (see below for
more technical details). In Figs
8,9, and 10, we identify the top 3 core economy-industry pairs
for each community. The first place is with thick and solid border. The second place is withthick and dashed border. The third place is with border and texture. In general, the cores are
mostly concentrated in the industries of agriculture (1), mining (2), food (3), metals (12), con-
struction (18), and financial, business, and public services (28 –31). Over time, while the ser-
vices industries (28 –31) have become the cores in more and more developed economies, the
primary industries (1 –3) have become less central in the developed economies and have only
remained as the cores in a few emerging economies, which is consistent with the Kuznets facts
[
40,41]. Furthermore, for the growing community centered on Germany, the cores are always
identified in Germany (that is why we simply call it the German community) for the three
selected years. It is also worth noting that, the German industry of transport equipment (15) is
identified as a core in 2011 and the car industry is the most integrated in the German commu-nity, which spans over 17 economies.
Some global-level indicators can also shed light on the regional dynamics of the WION. For
instance, Panel (A) in
Fig 11 shows the average weighted clustering coefficient over time for
three regions, EU27 (i.e., “Euro-Zone ”and“Non-Euro EU ”inS1 Table ), NAFTA (see S1
Table ), and East Asia (see S1 Table ). EU27 and NAFTA have higher coefficients than East Asia
and EU27 has an increasing trend over time, which coincides with the detection of the growingEuropean community led by Germany. On the other hand, Panel (B) in
Fig 11 considers the
intra-region foreign share out of the total foreign intermediate transactions for the same three
regions. EU27 relies on the intra-region foreign trade the most and East Asia the least. More-
over, while the intra-region share in the other two regions is roughly stable, it has a cleardecreasing trend in EU27, which at first glance seems to be at odds with the detection of the
growing European community led by Germany. One explanation for the contradiction is that,
although the intra-region share in an absolute sense has been decreasing in EU27, relative toother regions, EU27 has been restructured in such a way that it has developed much stronger
internal relationships than the external ones. Like what Zhu, Cerina, Chessa, Caldarelli, and
Riccaboni [
30] find in the international trade network, the peripheral countries have strong
World Input-Output Network
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134025 July 29, 2015 12 / 21
incentive to connect with Germany since it has the most external connections outside Europe.
As a result, centering on Germany, the European community structure has become more hier-
archical and significant over time even if the overall intra-region share of foreign intermediate
transactions has been declining. Therefore, some aspects of the regional dynamics can be cap-tured by using the global-level indicators along with the predetermined regions. However, thecommunity detection techniques are indispensable for understanding the regional dynamics
since the predetermined regions are often unavailable in practice and the global-level indicators
may be oversimplified and misleading.
Local Analysis of the WION
Finally, we conduct a local analysis of the nodes and identify the key industries in the WIONby comparing the network-based measures, i.e., PageRank centrality [
42] and community core-
ness measure [ 43], with the traditional methods of backward linkages, i.e., the Laumas method
of backward linkages [ 44] and the eigenvector method of backward linkages [ 45]. If we use ito
denote a summation vector of conformable size, i.e., a vector of all 1 ’s with the length conform-
able to the multiplying matrix, and let Fi=f, we then have Zi+f=x. Furthermore, if dividing
each column of Zby its corresponding total output in x, we get the so-called technical coeffi-
cients matrix A(The ratios are called technical coefficients because they represent the technol-
ogies employed by the industries to transform inputs into outputs.). Replacing Ziwith Ax,w e
rewrite the above equation as Ax+f=x. It can be rearranged as ( I−A)x=f. Finally, we can
solve xas follows:
x¼ðI/C0AÞ/C01f ð2Þ
where matrix ( I−A)−1is often denoted by Land is called the Leontief inverse.
The intuition behind the Leontief inverse is that an increase in the final demand of an indus-
try’s output will induce not only more production from the industry itself but also more from
other related industries because more inputs are required. Therefore, the Leontief inverse takes
into account both the direct and indirect effects of a demand increase. For instance, Lij
Fig 11. Regional clustering coefficient and intra-region foreign share of the foreign intermediate transactions over time. Panel (A) shows the
average weighted clustering coefficient over time for three regions, EU27 (i.e., “Euro-Zone ”and “Non-Euro EU ”inS1 Table ), NAFTA (see S1 Table ), and
East Asia (see S1 Table ). EU27 and NAFTA have higher coefficients than East Asia and EU27 has an increasing trend over time, which coincides with the
detection of the growing European community led by Germany. Panel (B) considers the intra-region foreign share out of the total foreign intermediate
transactions for the same three regions. EU27 relies on the intra-region foreign trade the most and East Asia the least. Moreover, while the intra-reg ion share
in the other two regions is roughly stable, it has a clear decreasing trend in EU27.

measures the total output produced in Industry igiven a one-unit increase in Industry j’s final
demand (The Leontief inverse is demand-driven, i.e., a repercussion effect triggered by an
increase in final demand. Another strand of the input-output economics literature is based onthe supply-driven model, where a repercussion effect is triggered by an increase in value added(primary inputs) [
46,47].). As a result, i0Lsums up each column of Land each sum measures
the total output of all the industries given a one-unit increase in the corresponding industry ’s
final demand. The vector i0Lis called the Rasmussen method of backward linkages [ 48] and
can be used to rank the industries and identify the key ones in the economy. However, as
pointed out by Laumas [ 44], the key assumption embedded in the Rasmussen method of back-
ward linkages is that every industry is assigned with the same weight (or unweighted), which isfar from the reality. The problem with the Rasmussen method can be demonstrated by using
the hypothetical data from
Table 1 . The calculated i0Lis [2.0688 1.8377 1.2223 1.1854], which
considers the industries in Economy 1 more important than the ones in Economy 2, despitethe fact that Economy 2 is much larger than Economy 1 in terms of total outputs.
The industries of the 40 economies covered in the WIOD are very heterogeneous in terms
of both total outputs and technical structure, which certainly makes the Rasmussen methodnot a good choice to identify the most central industries on a global scale. In order to identifythe key industries in the WIOD, we hence use the final-demand-weighted version of the Ras-
mussen method, i.e., the Laumas method of backward linkages [
44], which is denoted by wand
is defined here as the Hadamard (element-wise) product of the vector of the Rasmussen back-ward linkages and the vector of the percentage shares of the total final demand across indus-
tries, i.e.,
w¼i
0L/C14f0
i0fð3Þ
where /C14is the element-wise multiplication operator.
Table 2 shows the top 20 industries for the years 1995, 2003, and 2011, respectively. The
first column of each year is produced by the Laumas method of backward linkages, i.e., w. For
the selected years, only four large economies, China, Germany, Japan, and USA, ever qualifiedfor the top 20. Another noticeable change over time is the rise of China, which topped the listin 2011 with its industry of construction.
Although the Laumas method weights the industries according to their final demand, it
treats their neighbors (other directly connected industries) indifferently by merely countingthe total strength of linkages. This issue is addressed by the eigenvector method of backward
linkages [
45], which considers that an industry should have more linkages if it is connected
with other industries which have more linkages. In other words, not all neighbors of an indus-try are equal but the one with more linkages should be weighted more. Dietzenbacher [
45] cap-
tures this idea by using the left-hand eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of
the technical coefficients matrix A(or equivalently the Leontief inverse L) as an index to rank
the industries, which we denote as e. The ranking in the second column of each year in Table 2
is produced by the eigenvector method of backward linkages. It turns out that the top 20 indus-
tries over time are almost exclusively from China. The dominance of a single country is notsurprising because, as we find in the regional analysis of the WION, industries tend to clusteron a national basis. If some industries in China, say, transportation equipment, have high link-
ages, almost all other industries in China will automatically receive high linkages due to the
strong domestic connections and this process will reinforce itself. In this regard, the eigenvec-tor method is problematic because the importance of some peripheral industries is clearly over-
estimated if they have only an insignificant connection with the real hub. Another problem of
the eigenvector method is that it does not penalize the distant connections. In other words, the
World Input-Output Network
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134025 July 29, 2015 14 / 21
influence of linkages is perfectly transferred through the connections while in reality more dis-
tant connections are more likely to incur transmission loss.
The problems of the eigenvector method can be addressed by the network-based method,
PageRank centrality [ 42]. Like the eigenvector method, PageRank centrality considers that an
industry is important if it is connected with other important industries. However, PageRankcentrality also contains a damping factor that penalizes the distant connections and considers
that an industry is important if it is connected with other important industries and simulta-
neously those important industries in turn do not have other significant connections.
Since the WION is weighted, we use a weighted version of PageRank, which is computed
iteratively as follows:
1. At t= 0, an initial probability distribution is assumed, usually PRði;0Þ¼

Nwhere Nis the

where M(i) are the in-neighbors of i,wijis the weight of the link between the nodes iandj,S
is the sum of the weights of the outgoing edges from j, and the damping factor dis set to its
default value, 0.85.Table 2. Top 20 industries identified by the four methods for selected years. The first is the Laumas method of backward linkages, w. The second is the

InTable 2 , the third column of each year is produced by PageRank centrality, which is
denoted by PR. (Our PageRank result differs from the one reported by Carvalho [ 14], where he
uses an unweighted version of PageRank.) Unlike the traditional methods of backward link-ages, where only a few economies are among the top 20, the PageRank centrality recognizes 10economies in the top 20 list for the three selected years.
As significant communities are detected in the regional analysis of the WION, we also con-
sider another network-based method of identifying the key industries, i.e., community corenessmeasure. The idea of community coreness measure is that the nodes of a community do not
have the same importance for the community stability, i.e., the removal of a node in the core of
the community affects the partition much more than the deletion of a node that stays on theperiphery of the community [
43]. Therefore, in the following we define a novel way of detect-
ing cores inside communities by using the properties of the modularity function, i.e., Eq (1) .
By definition, if the modularity associated with a network has been optimized, every pertur-
bation in the partition leads to a negative variation in the modularity, d Q. If we relocate a node
from its community, we have M−1 possible choices, with Mas the number of communities, as
the node ’s new host community. It is possible to define the jdQjassociated with each node as
the smallest variation in absolute value (or the closest to 0 since d Qis always a negative num-
ber) of all the possible choices. We call jdQjthe community coreness measure.
In the WION, once we have the jdQjfor each industry, we can consider the one with the
biggest jdQjthe most important. We can also normalize the jdQjto identify the most impor-
tant nodes within each community. The results are already discussed above and are shown in
Figs8,9, and 10, where the first place in each community is with thick and solid border, the
second place is with thick dashed border, and the third place is with both border and texture.
InTable 2 , the fourth column of each year is produced by community coreness measure,
which is denoted again by jdQj. Like the Laumas method of backward linkages, the community
coreness measure also includes only China, Germany, Japan, and USA in the top 20 list for theselected years.
Now we have totally four methods to identify the key industries in the WION, the Laumas
method of backward linkages, the eigenvector method of backward linkages, PageRank centrality,
and community coreness measure. They have different results from each other. For instance, theindustry of transport equipment in Germany is captured by PageRank but not by the other three
while the industry of other business activities in USA is more important by jdQjthan by the
other three (see
Table 2 and the tables of the most important economies by industry and the
most important industries by economy identified by each method in Supporting Information).
Table 3 reports the correlation coefficient matrix among the four methods for the selected years
1995, 2003, and 2011. We find that all the four methods are positively correlated, while wand
jdQjare correlated even more and the correlations between eand others are the weakest. There-
fore, based on the advantages discussed above, the network-based jdQjandPRcan be used to
complement, if not to substitute, wandeto identify the key industries in the WION.
Discussion
This paper investigates a GMRIO system characterized by the recently available WIOD data-
base. By viewing the world input-output system as an interdependent network where the nodes
are the individual industries in different economies and the edges are the monetary goods
flows between industries, we study the network properties of the so-called world input-outputnetwork (WION) at global, regional, and local levels, and document its evolution over time.
We first quantify some global network properties of the WION such as assortativity, cluster-
ing coefficient, and degree and strength distributions. We find that both its assortativity and
World Input-Output Network
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134025 July 29, 2015 16 / 21
clustering coefficient are positively correlated with the foreign share of the intermediate trans-
actions over time. In other words, the increasingly integrated production chains tend to make
the WION more clustered and more assortative. We also observe that the 2008 –2009 financial
crisis creates a significant and disruptive effect on the global production chains and makes theWION less clustered and less assortative. Furthermore, we find that the degree distribution ofthe WION is highly left-skewed, which is the consequence of the highly aggregated industry
classification. On the other hand, the strength distribution of the WION is fat-tailed (log-nor-
mal). The fact that the industries are both highly connected, as captured by the degree distribu-tion, and asymmetrically connected, as captured by the strength distribution, implies that the
local idiosyncratic shocks are possible to propagate through the world economy and generate a
sizable global fluctuation, as vividly illustrated by the recent financial crisis. The increasing for-eign share of the intermediate transactions also implies the interdependence among national
policies. That is, policy makers have to be aware of the possibility that their industry-specific
policies can have not only an impact on the intended industry, but also unintended conse-quences on seemingly unrelated domestic and foreign markets, from which the intended indus-try typically sources goods and services.
We then focus on its subgraph structure and dynamics by using community detection tech-
niques. Even though most of the time the foreign share of the intermediate transactions hasbeen increasing, the integration of production chains is by and large regional rather than
global. That is, the world production is still operated nationally or at most regionally as the
communities detected are either individual economies or geographically well defined regions.In particular, we detect the emergence of a large European community led by Germany, which
is most likely the result of the production activities outsourced in recent years from Germany
to Central and Eastern European countries with lower labor costs and growing demand. Thisfinding also implies that the governance of the global production system can be practically
implemented at regional level and its success depends on a good understanding of the asym-
metrical roles played by different industries in different economies within the same region.
Finally, we quantify some local network properties of the WION and compare them with
the traditional methods of input-output analysis to identify the key industries. The traditional
methods we consider are the Laumas method of backward linkages [
44] and the eigenvector
method of backward linkages [ 45] while the network-based methods we consider are PageRank
centrality [ 42] and community coreness measure [ 43]. We find that the methods rank the
industries differently because they capture different aspects of the connections. Nevertheless,
we argue that the network-based measures can give valuable insights into identifying the keyindustries. At first glance, it may seem that the eigenvector method of backward linkages and
PageRank centrality share the same spirit since both of them consider that an industry isTable 3. Correlation coefficient matrix among the four key-industry-identification methods for selected years. The first is the Laumas method of back-

important if it is connected with other important industries. However, two potential problems
with the eigenvector method of backward linkages are that if an important industry is con-
nected with many industries then all those industries will automatically become “important ”
while in reality they may be just peripheral industries and that it does not penalize the distantconnections while in reality the distant connections are often associated with transmission loss.
Unlike the eigenvector method of backward linkages, PageRank centrality contains a damping
factor that penalizes the distant connections and considers that an industry is important if it isconnected with other important industries and simultaneously those important industries in
turn do not have other significant connections. On the other hand, community coreness mea-
sure considers that an industry is more important if it matters more in terms of reserving thecommunity structure of the network. Therefore, special attention should be given to the indus-
tries with high community coreness when policy makers seek to understand and to restructure
the production chains.
We conclude the paper by discussing some future extensions. As mentioned above, due to
the limited coverage of the WIOD, we cannot argue if the input-output integration is also
observed in other continents. Therefore, in our future work, we plan to use some GMRIO data-bases with better coverage. One possible choice is the EORA [
49,50], which covers about 187
countries in the world and the years from 1990 to 2011. Moreover, although we have shown
that the network approach can be used as a complement to the conventional input-output
methods to retrieve more information from the input-output tables, a more systematic com-parison between input-output analysis and network analysis is needed to foster fruitful interac-
tion between the two.

deflator across the 9 major member economies in the German community detected in 2011,i.e., Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia,and Poland. During 1995 –2011, the average inflation of the German community was almost
always below that of all the WIOD economies. The data source is the World Development

with the average exchange rate across the 9 major economies in the German communitydetected in 2011, i.e., Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slo-
vakia, Slovenia, and Poland. The average exchange rate of the German community was basi-
cally below that of all the WIOD economies before 2000. Only from 2001, the communityaverage became slightly (no more than 16%) higher than the overall average. The data source isthe exchange rate data used in the WIOD. Therefore, the emergence of the German community
cannot be attributed to inflation or exchange rate dynamics.
