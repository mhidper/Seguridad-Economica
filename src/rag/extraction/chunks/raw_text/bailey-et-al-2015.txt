Abstract
United Nations (UN) General Assembly votes have become the standard data
source for measures of states preferences over foreign policy. Most papers use
dyadic indicators of voting similarity between states. We propose a dynamic ordinal
spatial model to estimate state ideal points from 1946 to 2012 on a single dimension
that reflects state positions toward the US-led liberal order. We use information
about the content of the UN’s agenda to make estimates comparable across time.
Compared to existing measures, our estimates better separate signal from noise in
identifying foreign policy shifts, have greater face validity, allow for better inter-
temporal comparisons, are less sensitive to shifts in the UN’ agenda, and are strongly
correlated with measures of liberalism. We show that the choice of preference
measures affects conclusions about the democratic peace.

Foreign policy preferences play a crucial role in international relations theory. Yet,
they are not directly observed and thus n eed to be inferred from observable beha-
vior. Votes in the United Nations Ge neral Assembly (UNGA) have become the
standard data source for constructing measures of state preferences, as they are
comparable and observable actions take nb ym a n yc o u n t r i e sa ts e tp o i n t si nt i m e .
Unfortunately, with few exceptions, s cholars have ignored methodological
advances in the roll call literature on ho w to estimate latent preferences from
observed votes. Moreover, existing measures fail to separate changes in the UN’s
agenda from shifts in state preferences. C onsequently, these m easures frequently
suggest that states change their foreign policy orientations when all that changes
is the content of votes.
We develop a state-of-the-art ideal point model to estimate dynamic national
ideal points along a single dimension from 1946 to 2012. We use resolutions that
were identical across years to serve as bridge observations to help make the prefer-
ence estimates comparable over time. The resulting estimates consistently capture
the position of states vis-a `-vis a US-led liberal order. During the Cold War, this was
the East–West conflict between communist and capitalist states. Since the end of the
Cold War, the non-Western pole has been occupied by a motley crew of states that
have little ideological cohesion other than their opposition to the Western liberal
order.
Our estimates have several advantages over dyadic similarity indicators such as
affinity or S scores (Gartzke 1998, Signorino and Ritter 1999). First, our estimates
allow for more valid intertemporal comparisons. For example, according to S scores,
Russia and the United States have more conflictual relations in the mid-2000s than
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the United States ever had dur-
ing the Cold War. By separating agenda changes from changes in preferences, we
offer more plausible estimates of long-term shifts in this and other relationships.
This matters given the frequent usage of UN-based preference measures in dynamic
analyses.
Second, our estimates are better able to distinguish signal from noise in identify-
ing meaningful shifts in foreign policy orientations. For example, ideal points anal-
ysis of our ideal point estimates consistently indicates that left-wing regimes in Latin
America were systematically less favorable to the United States than right-wing
regimes. We do not find this pattern with S scores.
Finally, dyadic indicators can only reveal shifts in preference similarity between
two states but not which state has shifted. Ideal point estimates allow us to assess, for
instance, whether the Soviet Union or the United States was responsible for the two
states moving closer or further apart. This allows researchers to examine foreign pol-
icy orientations in monadic analyses. Moreover, we offer assessments of uncertainty
in our point estimates.
We first discuss how UN votes have been used in the literature. We then explain
our estimation method and data. The following section evaluates the validity of our
estimates. Finally, we replicate an application to the study of conflict (Gartzke 2000)Bailey et al. 431
and find that replacing affinity measures with ideal point estimates makes the orig-
inal findings robust to modeling the dynamics appropriately.
Literature, Data, and Method
The Use of UN Votes in the Literature
Scholars have used UN votes to measure foreign policy preferences virtually since
the institution was established (e.g., Ball 1951; Lijphart 1963; Moon 1985; Vengroff
1976; Russett 1966). This interest shows little sign of abating. We found seventy-
five articles published between 1998 and 2012 that used UN votes to construct mea-
sures of national preferences.
Many papers use UN-based preference measures as independent variables. These
include analyses of whether foreign policy interests affect the likelihood of interstate
disputes (e.g., Gartzke 1998; Oneal and Russett 1999; Reed et al. 2008), the severity
of those disputes (Sweeney 2003), the occurrence of acts of terrorism (Dreher and
Gassebner 2008), the distribution of foreign aid (e.g., Alesina and Dollar 2000), the
lending behavior of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF, e.g.,
Thacker 1999; Dreher and Jensen 2007), the probability of signing treaties (Koreme-
nos 2005), and the reception of diplomatic missions (Neumayer 2008).
Others have used UN-based measures as dependent variables to ascertain whether
socialization through intergovernmental organizations leads to convergence in
member state interests (Bearce and Bondanella 2007), whether leadership and
regime changes alter foreign policy orientations (Dreher and Jensen 2013), whether
the European Union has started to form a cohesive foreign policy (Drieskens 2010),
whether the United States is becoming increasingly isolated on foreign policy issues
(Voeten 2004), or whether US or Chinese foreign aid or trade successfully buys for-
eign policy adherence (Flores-Macı ´as and Kreps 2013).
Voting in the UN differs from some other voting bodies in that three explicit vote
options are widely and deliberately used in the UN: yea, nay, or abstain. The infor-
mative abstentions are an important feature of voting and virtually all studies treat a
nay vote as a stronger signal of disapproval than an abstention.1Abstentions differ
from absences. Absences typically do not reflect a country’s views but instead are
due to causes such as a temporary lack of government. Absences are strongly corre-
lated with the occurrence of civil wars and coups (Voeten 2013). In 68 percent of
votes where a state is absent, it will also be absent on the next roll call. This suggests
strongly that absences are not usually indications of discontent with a resolution and
should thus not be equated with abstentions, as some scholars do (Rosas, Shomer,
and Haptonstahl 2015).
Most existing UN-based preference measures are based on dyadic similarity of
vote choices. The most widely used is Signorino and Ritter’s (1999) S score.2
S scores treat UN votes as interval-level measures of preference expression with
abstentions halfway between a yea and a nay vote (they exclude absences).3The432 Journal of Conflict Resolution 61(2)
S score is a Euclidean distance measure between every dyad in the UN. It is calcu-
lated as:
Sab¼1/C0X
jYau/C0Ybuj
V;
where u¼1,...Vindexes votes, aandbrefer to two countries, and Yrefers to votes,
taking on one of three alternatives: fyea (Y¼1), abstain ( Y¼2), and nay ( Y¼3)g.
The S score equals 1 if two countries agree on all votes and /C01 if two countries
maximally disagree on all resolutions.
The core weakness of S scores and related similarity indices is that they assume a
straightforward relationship between how often two states vote together and prefer-
ence similarity. Yet, voting coincidence is also affected by what resolutions states
vote on. Suppose there are ten votes and that country A and country B vote identi-
cally on nine of them. In the next session, suppose that the countries preferences do
not change, but there happen to be ten additional votes on the single issue that
divided the two countries. The similarity index of the two countries would drop from
90 percent on the first ten votes to 50 percent on all twenty votes even as their pre-
ferences did not change.
The S score approach differs sharply from contemporary measurement models
used for other voting bodies, where scholars invariably use spatial models and item
response theory (IRT) empirical methods (e.g., Poole 2005).
Spatial models offer an explicit theory of how states translate preferences into
votes. Two features of these models allo w them to measure preferences in a way
that does not ebb and flow according to the composition of votes in a voting body.
First, spatial models estimate vote cut point s that identify points along a preference
spectrum where countries vote in a particu lar way. This makes it possible to attri-
bute changes in similarity due to changes in agenda rather than simply assuming all
changes in voting similarity reflect preference changes. Second, spatial models
estimate ‘‘discrimination parameters’’ t hat tell us how well individual roll calls
distinguish between states with differ ent ideal points along a dimension. These
parameters effectively all ow us to weight votes by how much they reflect the main
preference dimension. If a series of votes appear that have little to do with the main
dimension of preferences, they will not exert much influence on ideal point esti-
mates. This contrasts with similarity indi ces which weight all votes identically and
will ebb and flow as these votes influenced by idiosyncratic factors come and go
from the agenda.
Figure 1 illustrates how spatial models account for agenda change. There are
seven countries with ideal points y1toy7. On vote 1, the cut points gare such that
two countries vote nay (solid triangles), two abstain (open circles), and three vote
yea (solid squares). On vote 2, only two countries vote nay, four abstain, and two
vote yea. On vote 3, the polarity of the vote is reversed so that the high ycountries
are those more inclined to vote yea. The coalition is similar to that on vote 1, only for
this vote most yeas from vote 1 have become nays and vice versa.Bailey et al. 433
If the agenda changed from having many votes like vote 1 to many votes like vote
2, a similarity index would indicate a major split in countries 5 and 6 and a major
warming of relations of countries 4 and 5. But in fact, these countries could have
completely unchanged preferences and their voting would only change due to the
changes in the types of votes on which they expressed their views.
Spatial models also give us tools to lessen the influence of idiosyncratic votes on
preference estimates. An idiosyncratic vote is one that divides countries based on fac-
tors unrelated to the main preference dimension. For example, in some years, North–
South divisions over UN supranationalism pitted the powerful states (including the
USSR and the United States) against developing nations (Voeten 2000). These votes
provide no meaningful information on the position of states on a pro-anti-West dimen-
sion. Vote 4 in Figure 1 depicts such a case as votes are poorly explained by the coun-
tries’ ideal points: countries 1 and 4 abstain, while countries 3 and 6 vote nay and the
rest vote yea. A similarity index such as the S score would take this vote as evidence of
changes in preferences among countries, while a spatial model will place less weightVote 2

on such votes because they are poorly explained by ideal points. We discuss this para-
meter in more detail when we present our model subsequently.
While spatial models provide a structure for distinguishing agenda change from
preference change, they do not automatically distinguish wholesale shifts in prefer-
ences from wholesale shifts in vote parameters. For example, if all country ideal points
(y) moved one step to the left, this is mathematically equivalent to all cut points ( g)
moving one step to the right. Therefore, Bailey (2007, 2013) and Voeten (2004) pin
down the location of vote cut points by using information about the location of vote
cut points over time. By utilizing information that vote cut points on a subset of votes
were the same from one year to the next, their models could appropriately interpret
any change in votes on these votes would have to be due to preference change.
With some exceptions (Voeten 2000, 2004; Reed et al. 2008; Mattes, Leeds, and Car-
roll 2015; Andersen, Harra, and Tarp 2006), spatial theory and IRT models have not
been applied to the UN. One reason is that standard software packages for ideal point
estimation do not easily incorporate votes with three choices. Moreover, existing ideal
point approaches are not dynamic and do not separate agenda from preference change.4
Statistical Model
Our approach is to use IRT statistical models to estimate one-dimensional prefer-
ences that are comparable over time based on votes in the UN. The model is based
on the multiple rater ordinal data model of Johnson and Albert (1999, 166). Let i¼
1,...Nindex states and u¼1,...Vindex votes. States have unidimensional ‘‘ideal
points’’ in each year ( yit).
The vote by a country on a given resolution is a function of its ideal point, char-
acteristics of the vote, and random error. Specifically, the spatial preference of each
country on each vote is Zitu¼buyitþ2 iu, with 2iu*Nð0;1Þ0, which is a latent vari-
able.buis analogous to the discrimination parameter in standard IRT models. The
sign of buindicates the ‘‘polarity’’ of vote u: on some resolutions (such as vote 1
in Figure 1), high yitcountries are inclined to vote yea, and buwill be positive for
these votes. buwill be negative when high yitcountries are inclined to vote nay (such
as vote 3 in Figure 1). The magnitude of buindicates how well vote useparates coun-
tries with high and low ideal points. A bunear zero indicates vote uis poorly
explained by ideal points and is associated with a muddle of yea, abstain, and nay
voting across the ideological spectrum, as in vote 4 of Figure 1.
Each vote has three alternatives: fyea ( Y¼1), abstain ( Y¼2), and nay ( Y¼
3)g.The observed choice, Yitu, depends on Z itu, the latent vote-specific preference
of country i, and cut points g1uandg2u. Formally, the conditions that determine
which alternative a country chooses on vote uare:
Yitu¼1i f Zitu<g1u
Yitu¼2i f g1u<Zitu<g2u
Yitu¼3i f Zitu>g2u:Bailey et al. 435

for all votes. We assume that absences are distributed as missing at random as in
Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers (2004). In a possible future extension, one might
examine more nuanced models of absences along the lines of those proposed by
Rosas and Shomer (2008) and Rosas, Shomer, and Haptonstahl (2015).
All ideal point models need to be identified with a normalization. We fix ideal
points to be centered on zero with a standard deviation of 1. We implement our
across-time bridging by imposing a restriction that resolutions with the same content
have the same outpoints, g1andg2. The assumption is that a resolution at time thas
the same resolution parameters as an identically phrased resolution at time tþ1.
This is a weaker assumption than that made in studies that jointly scale legislators
with constituents or judges, where it may not necessarily be true that an identically
phrased proposal means the same thing to a legislator and a constituent (Lewis and
Tausanovich 2013). Context could change too with time, which is why we limit to
five the number of consecutive years in which the resolution parameters are fixed.
We implement a Bayesian prior on the estimate for yitbased on yi,t/C01. The var-
iance of this prior determines how much smoothing occurs. If variance of the prior is
set at a very large value, then almost no smoothing occurs and we essentially esti-
mate preferences separately for each year for each country with the preference in the
previous period providing no information about preferences in the next period. If the
variance of the prior is set at a very small value, then preferences change very little
from one period to the next, meaning we essentially estimate a single ideal point for
each country for the entire time period. As discussed in Martin and Quinn (2002,
147), specific estimates can be sensitive to the setting of such a parameter and there
is no consensus way to determine its value. As with Martin and Quinn, we set this
value at a point at which the estimates do indeed move from period to period but not
too dramatically. The advantage to this approach compared to estimating ideal point
change as a polynomial function over time (as in Voeten 2004) is that it allows for
discrete shifts in ideal points, for example, responding to regime change. The prior
will soften these shifts but will not make them conform to a specific functional form
over time.
We use a hybrid Metropolis–Hasting/Gibbs sampler to estimate the parameters of
the model following the process described in Johnson and Albert (1999, 135, 166)
and Cowles (1996). The Appendix contains more details on the estimation process.
Like all efforts to extract preference estimates from observed votes, we can only
measure revealed preferences rather than underlying ‘‘true’’ preferences. The vote of
a state on any given resolution may be a function not only of their unrestricted pre-
ferences but also of other motives. Given that UNGA votes are nonbinding, we sus-
pect that strategic voting is less prevalent than in other arenas of world politics, such436 Journal of Conflict Resolution 61(2)
as the UN Security Council. The influence of some factors such as foreign aid could
be modeled empirically based on the ideal points we estimate (Dreher, Nunnen-
kamp, and Thiele 2008; Dreher and Sturm 2012; Carter and Stone 2015).
Data
The data come from Strezhnev and Voeten (2013) and include 4,335 divisive roll
calls over sixty-seven sessions from January 1946 to December 2012. As in all ideal
point estimations, we limit the analysis to resolutions adopted with a vote. About a
quarter of all UNGA votes are adopted without a representative requesting a roll call
(Hage and Hug 2013). Such votes provide no information for ideal point estimation.
We analyze preferences for each country for each UN session. Sessions usually
start in September and occasionally run into the new year. A more detailed discus-
sion is in Voeten (2013).
In order to identify preference change over time, we coded whether resolutions
are identical. Resolutions are nonbinding. Even adopted resolutions do not necessa-
rily alter the status quo. It is therefore common for consecutive sessions to vote on
duplicate resolutions. We identified duplicates by first downloading pdf files of all
General Assembly Resolutions from the UN website and converting the files to
machine-readable text. We then used plagiarism detection software WCopyFind
3.0.2 (Bloomfield 2011) to estimate the similarity between resolution texts.5Small
changes in words can meaningfully alter political support for resolutions. We there-
fore first selected resolutions that were plausibly identical because they returned
high similarity scores in WCopyFind and then manually inspected them to confirm
that no substantial differences existed.6If resolutions differ only in inconsequential
ways (such as dates or references to past resolutions), we treated them as identical.
This procedure led to 799 pairs of identical resolutions.
There are some differences between the matched and unmatched resolutions.
Based on a model with session fixed effects, the percentage of yes votes on matched
resolutions is on average about 3 percent higher than on nonmatched votes (from an
average of 57 to 60 percent). Matched resolutions are also somewhat more likely to
be resolutions on colonialism and the Middle East and somewhat less likely to be
about human rights and disarmament. Yet, these differences are modest. For exam-
ple, human rights resolutions, the most underrepresented category, constitute 16.5
percent of unmatched resolutions and 14.6 percent of matched resolutions.
Most of the time, states do not alter their positions on matched resolutions: 97.2
percent of nonmissing vote choices were the same from one year to the next. The
United States changed somewhat more frequently than average (4.2 percent of the
time). Yet these are very informative data points if we wish to identify changes in
foreign policy preferences.
We also estimated the model on the subsample of 336 votes identified as impor-
tant by the State Department since 1983. Similarity indicators based on this subset of
votes are often used in applied work.Bailey et al. 437
Validity
This section examines the validity of our ideal point estimates in four ways. First, we
assess whether the changes in ideal points make sense, given what we know about
post–World War II history. Second, we examine whether ideal point estimates are
affected by changes in the agenda. Third, we explore which substantive areas most
reflect underlying preference differences in UN voting. Fourth, we ascertain whether
the ideal points are associated with democratization, financial liberalization, and
government ideology in the ways scholars would expect.
To compare ideal points to S scores, we transform ideal points into dyadic mea-
sures by taking the absolute distance between the ideal points of two countries (mul-
tiplied by /C01 to give both measures the same sign). The bivariate Pearson
correlation between the distances in ideal points and the S scores is .82. This is fairly
high but, as we shall see, the differences are consequential especially in intertem-
poral comparisons.
Face Validity
Figure 2 plots the S scores and the absolute distance between the ideal points for the
United States and the USSR/Russia. Both measures capture a dramatic change
immediately when the Cold War ends. Yet there are important differences. First,
S scores imply implausible intertemporal comparisons. If we believe S scores, the
United States and the USSR had much more similar interests during several periods
of the Cold War (mid-1950s and mid-1970s) than during most of the post–Cold War
period with the exception of a few years in the early 1990s. Indeed, 1989, 2008, and
2009 are the darkest years in the relationship between these two countries according
to S scores, with an equally implausible warming of ties since. This defies common
sense.
Second, S scores fluctuate tremendously during the Cold War plausibly due to
changes in the relative importance of the second dimension. In the early 1970s, the
group of seventy-seven gained control of the UNGA’s agenda, introducing many
new resolutions on UN supranationalism and other North–South issues on which the
USSR and the United States took similar positions (Voeten 2000). This led to large
increases in the number of times the two states voted together (and consequentially
S scores) but not in their positions on the main underlying dimension of contestation,
as correctly captured by relatively stable ideal point estimates. Similarly, in the mid-
1950s, the Suez crisis was a particular event (with many associated votes) that pitted
the United States against its Western allies. It did not, however, reflect a fundamen-
tal easing of relations between the superpowers as the S scores would suggest. By
contrast, the ideal point estimates are fairly consistent during the Cold War and accu-
rately keep the two countries much further apart during the Cold War than at any
point after.438 Journal of Conflict Resolution 61(2)
Third, despite greater volatility, S scores sometimes fail to detect real shifts in prefer-
ences. Most notably, the ideal point measure picks up on Gorbachev’s efforts to reconcile
with the West in the mid-1980s, while S scores pick up on a change only in 1991.
This latter point is made more clearly in Figure 3, which plots ideal point esti-
mates for the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (P-5). It is the
Soviet Union rather than the United States, which moves in the 1980s.
Figure 3 also paints a broader picture of great power ideology in the post–World
War II period. In the 1950s and early 1960s, France and the United Kingdom took a
more extreme ‘‘Western’’ position than the United States, as they desperately clung
to their empires. The gap between the United States and its Western allies has
increased since the Reagan Administration, which notably departed from the Carter
Administration. The People’s Republic of China, which did not take a UN seat until
1971, initially canvassed with the nonaligned states near the center of the ideological
space. Tensions with the West increased after Tiananmen square. Moreover, the col-
lapse of the Soviet Union left China without a foe on the opposite side of the ideo-
logical spectrum. Since the late 1990s, China has taken a much more pragmatic and
active approach in the UN. China’s ideal point never moves as far in opposition to the
Western liberal order as the USSR’s did during the Cold War. By contrast, S scores
between the United States and China during the 1990s (not shown) were lower than
those between the United States and the USSR at anytime during the Cold War.
One concern is that spatial models (like S scores) may not be able to distinguish
sincere preferences from strategic concerns, such as a desire to get aid or other

concessions from powerful states in exchange for votes. Although UNGA votes are
nonbinding and less strategic than those in venues such as the UN Security Council,
there is evidence of strategic voting (Carter and Stone 2015). This may be especially
pertinent on votes important to the United States, which are resolutions on which the
US lobbies and where the correlation between US foreign aid and voting patterns is
especially high (Wang 1999). Therefore, we also estimated ideal points based only
on a subsample of votes on which the US state department declared it lobbied other

countries in Voting Practices in the United Nations , an annual report the state depart-
ment has issued to Congress since 1983. The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows ideal
point estimates for P-5 countries based on these votes. The broad patterns are the
same, but minor differences do exist and these may be the more appropriate mea-
sures for some analyses. The bivariate correlation between ideal points estimated
based on important votes and all votes is .92.
Other comparisons also reveal substantial differences between ideal points and
S scores. Figure 4a plots the ideal point distance (multiplied by /C01 for comparability)
between several Latin American states and the United States. Regime changes widely
known to have affected foreign policy orientations also affected ideal point shifts.
Cuba shifted rapidly following the 1959 revolution. Chile quickly and temporarily
shifted away from the United States during the Allende regime but moved back after
the 1973 coup. The fall of the Pinochet regime led to a small shift away from the West-
ern position but not to the extent of the left-wing governments. Venezuela shifted
away from the United States following the election of Hugo Cha ´vez. Argentina
became much more pro-West following the election of Carlos Menem in 1989. Nicar-
agua’s changes correspond closely to the rise and fall of Sandinista governments.
Figure 4b shows the same data but now calculated as S scores with the United
States. The lines also capture the main regime shifts, but they are much harder to
distinguish from other bumps. For example, the Allende government is barely dis-
tinguishable from other small shifts in Chile’s S scores. Moreover, the Latin Amer-
ican states are very difficult to differentiate since 1970. For the most part, Figure 4b
shows a uniform shift away from the United States. For example, S scores portray
Cuba and Chile as similar to each other in foreign policy preference with a massive
gap between Chile and the United States. According to S scores, Chile was as far
from the United States in the 2000s as Cuba was in the late 1960s. In contrast, ideal
points properly put Chile and Argentina quite a bit closer to the United States than
Venezuela and Cuba.
Agenda Change
What explains the large differences between the ideal points and the S scores? The
major difference in the approaches is that the ideal points are based on a model that
explicitly addresses agenda change. Therefore, we turn to examining how much the
two preference measures are affected by substantive content of the votes.
Table 1 shows results from a lagged-dependent variable model in which the
dependent variables are country ideal points (column 1) and S scores with the United
States (column 2). The independent variables are annual issue proportions. We
coded whether resolutions concerned colonialism, the Middle East, nuclear issues,
disarmament, human rights, and/or economic issues (see Voeten 2013). Resolutions
could fit into multiple categories or none.
The results indicate that the two preference measures respond very differently to
changes in the agenda. None of the issue proportions correlate significantly withBailey et al. 441
ideal points (model 1). By contrast, most of the issue proportions are associated with
statistically significant changes in S scores with the United States (model 2). Varia-
tion in the proportion of nuclear issues is especially strongly correlated with

we also estimated a static model with fixed country effects and annual issue propor-
tions. This model accounts for 36 percent of the variation within country S scores

with the United States but only 3 percent of the variation in country ideal points
(results available from authors). Qualitatively identical results hold with an error-
correction model (ECM) and if we add fixed country effects. This confirms that
a large proportion of variation in dyadic S scores has less to do with country-
specific preference change than with changes in the UNGA’s agenda.
In columns 3 and 4, we show results from the same model estimated on all dyads.
Again, issue proportions correlate strongly and significantly with S scores (model 3).
Here, we also find significant effects when we use ideal point differences as the
dependent variable (model 4). Yet, the substantive effects are small compared to
those on S scores. When we standardize the coefficients from the table, we find that
none of the standardized coefficients on ideal point similarity exceeds 0.004 (the
standardized coefficients on economic and Middle East). All but one (nuclear disar-
mament) of the standardized coefficients on S scores exceed 0.004.
Other analyses lead to similar conclusions. In a country fixed effect model,
annual issue proportions explain 17 percent of the within country variation in dyadic
S scores and just 3 percent in the variation in ideal point similarity. In an ECM with
fixed country effects for ideal points, many of the issue proportions are no longerTable 1. Lagged-Dependent Variable Regressions of Ideal Points and S Scores on Annual

significant, whereas all of the issue proportions remain significant in such a speci-
fication for S scores.
An alternative test is to examine how sus ceptible ideal point estimates are to
annual shocks. We estimated a regression with country fixed effects and indica-
tor variables for each year. The year dummies explain only 4 percent of the var-
iation in ideal points.7Thus, there is little evidence that ideal points move up
and down due to common shocks rather than individual countries changing their
positions.
Year dummies explain 50 percent of the variation in S scores between the United
States and other countries. This compares to 27 percent of the variation in ideal point
distances with the United States (remember S scores are dyadic so we must compare
with ideal point distances). If we examine S scores and ideal point similarities in all
dyads (with dyad fixed effects), year dummies explain 11 %of the variation in
S scores and 2 percent of the variation in ideal point distances. In sixty out of
sixty-six years, all dyadic S scores significantly (at the 5 percent level) move in the
same direction. This is again consistent with the notion that a large portion of varia-
tion in S scores is a consequence of common shocks to the agenda rather than indi-
vidual states changing their positions.
Simply regressing S scores on year dummies and using the residuals as a prefer-
ence measure would be one way to improve on existing practices. Nevertheless, this
is an ad hoc solution, which does not address the other advantages of ideal point
methods, and it would incorrectly adjust for instances where there are real common
shocks to preferences, such as with the end of the Cold War.
Substantive Content of Preferences
We can also use variation in issue proportions over time to gain some insight into the
substantive interpretation of the preference dimension that dominates UN voting. To
do this, we regressed the absolute values of the estimated discrimination parameter
buon the issue codes. To recall, the discrimination parameter is an estimate of the
weight a resolution has, which is based on the extent to which conflict on the reso-
lution reflects conflict along our single dimension. On average, human rights resolu-
tions have a discrimination parameter that is higher by 0.35 (half a standard
deviation) than the reference category (resolutions that do not fit any of the issue
categories). Colonialism issues (0.31), economic issues (0.12), and disarmament
issues (0.09) also have significantly higher than average discrimination parameters,
but Middle East issues and nuclear issues do not.8
This fits the substantive interpretation of the dimension as being about a liberal
world order. Human rights resolutions weigh heavily, especially after the end of the
Cold War, as they signify conflict between liberal and nonliberal states. By contrast,
resolutions on nuclear weapons often (though not always) separate the nuclear haves
from the have-nots. This means that all permanent members of the UN Security
Council tend to vote on the same side. The proportion of resolutions that deal with444 Journal of Conflict Resolution 61(2)
this issue varies considerably, from zero in some years to about 30 percent in others
(see Voeten 2013). This may lead us to wrongly conclude that the P-5 are much
closer one year than they are the next simply because there are more resolutions
on nuclear issues. This may be especially problematic for applications that use
UN votes to construct measures of great power agreement (e.g., Copelovitch 2010).
We do not argue that conflicts over nuclear issues or the Middle East are unim-
portant. Yet they are not always conflicts over the liberal world order. To be clear,
we do not a priori exclude any issue areas or resolutions from our analysis. Instead,
resolution weights are estimated based on the extent to which votes discriminate
countries along the primary dimension of conflict. Analysts primarily interested in
nuclear or Middle East issues should use our data and method to estimate a separate
set of ideal points. We did so for Middle East issues and found that the resulting esti-
mates are reasonably correlated with our first dimension estimates (Pearson correla-
tion is .83). Yet, these estimates reflect some distinct position taking on the Middle
East and are therefore probably more suitable for predicting votes on the admission
of Palestine as a state or other predictive tasks with regard to the Middle East.
Correlation with Democracy, Financial Liberalization,
and Government Ideology
We can also examine the validity of our ideal point measures by analyzing temporal
variation in ideal points. Changes within a country should reflect changes in state
characteristics rather than common shocks to the agenda. In this section, we compare
how ideal point similarity with the United States (distance in ideal points multiplied
by/C01 for comparability) and S scores respond to domestic changes that should the-
oretically correlate with a Western liberal foreign policy outlook. We focus on three
factors: democracy, financial openness, and left-wing governments.
We estimate ECMs with fixed country effects, as we are interested in explaining
shifts within countries. The models estimate both short- and long-term effects of
domestic attributes (see De Boef and Keele 2008). Coefficients on lagged variables
are short-run effects, and coefficients on changes in variables are long-run effects.
We report separate results for each independent variable due to concerns that the
various domestic liberalism measures are endogenous to each other and due to large
numbers of missing values for two of our measures.
Table 2 presents results from multiple specifications. Ideal points are the depen-
dent variables in the three columns on the left; S scores are the dependent variables
in the three columns on the right.
We can compare the results in columns 1 and 4 to see the association of democ-
racy and ideal points and S scores. These columns include Polity 4 scores (rescaled
to a 0–1 scale), a widely used measure of democracy. Column 1 indicates that both
lagged levels and annual changes in levels of democracy are correlated with shifts
toward the United States. That is, there is both an immediate and a long-run link
between countries democratizing and moving closer to the US ideal point. ColumnBailey et al. 445
4 reports a strong and significant negative correlation with democratization and
S scores with the United States, exactly opposite of natural expectations that demo-
cratization is related to affinity with the Western-led world order.
We can compare the results in columns 2 and 5 to see the association of finan-
cial openness and ideal points and S scores . These specifications include a single
scale that combines Quinn and Toyoda’s ( 2008) measures of current and capital
account openness (also rescaled to the 0–1 interval). This measure is used in the
literature on the capitalist peace (Gartzke 2007), although it is only available for
a limited number of countries. The effects are strong. A country that shifts from
a fully closed to a fully open economy is expected to move about 0.2 toward the
US side of the ideal point dimension, w ith additional long-run effects implied
by the positive and significant coefficie nt on the lagged level. We only find a weak
correlation with S scores.
Columns 3 and 6 assess the relationship between government ideology and close-
ness to the United States. Column 3 shows that shifts from a non-left- to a left-wing
government are associated with a small but significant shift away from the WesternTable 2. ECMs with Country Characteristics on Ideal Point and S score Similarity with the

pole of the first dimension. Column 6 shows that this effect is only significant with
S scores at the 10 percent level.
We also estimated the last model on the subsample of Latin American countries, a
group viewed to have shifted away from the United States during left-wing regimes
and toward the United States during right-wing regimes. The difference between the
left and right coefficient is significant at p< .001 when the dependent variable is
either the ideal point of a Latin American country or the absolute distance with the
United States. By contrast, the difference between left and right governments does
not reach conventional levels of significance for S scores. Here, again the ideal point
estimates reflect conventional wisdom about foreign policy change while the
S scores do not.
None of the models in Table 2 include year fixed effects. Including year fixed
effects could change results if either (a) all countries move the same amount toward
or away from the United States in many years or (b) the preference measures them-
selves are moving systematically in each year due to agenda change. The ideal point
measures are designed not to be affected by agenda change while the S scores could
be affected by both types of year fixed effects. When we estimate the abovemen-
tioned models and include year fixed effects, the results for the ideal point models
are virtually unchanged. The results for the S scores change substantially, however.
With fixed year effects, the coefficients on democracy and financial openness
become positive and significant.9
Using both S scores and ideal point estimates, we would conclude that countries
become more similar to the US foreign policy position if they democratize, move
toward an open market economy, and move away from left-wing governments. Yet,
with S scores, these effects only become visible after factoring out common annual
shocks due to agenda changes. Without these, sometimes the correlations point in
the opposite direction than expected. This is a serious problem for applications in
which S scores are independent variables that supposedly capture within-country
variation in foreign policy positions.
Preferences and Conflict
To what extent does it matter whether scholars use ideal point measures or an affi-
nity measure such as S scores? If ideal point measures contain less noise and more
signal, then they should strengthen empirical findings if the theory is correct. To
evaluate this, we replicate Gartzke (1998), a seminal study that popularized the use
of UN votes as measures of state preferences. This article argues that the relative
absence of conflict between democratic states is an artifact of the common prefer-
ences of democratic dyads. Including a measure of UNGA voting similarity in the
original democratic peace model from Oneal and Russett (1997), the article finds
that affinity strongly correlates with the incidence of militarized interstate disputes
(MIDs) and possibly explains away the effect of joint democracy. Gartzke (2000)
updated this model in response to a critique by Oneal and Russett (1999).Bailey et al. 447
We reestimate the logistic regression reported in table 1, model 2 of Gartzke
(2000), attempting to match the original data set as closely as possible. The sample
consists of all politically relevant dyads from 1950 to 1985. In addition to the prefer-
ence similarity measure, the model includes seven covariates.10We construct all of the
variables exactly as in Gartzke (2000), except for the original affinity scores, which we
update to reflect corrections in the UNGA roll call data set.11Because of data revi-
sions, the affinity measure from the original article differs from the most current S
score implementation. It is important to make this minor adjustment to the original
model in order to ensure that differences between the ideal point measure and S scores
are not simply due to changes in the data being used. The dependent variable takes on
a value of 1 if an MID occurred or was ongoing for a given dyad year and 0 otherwise.
We first estimate the original reported regression model presented without any
corrections to account for temporal dependence that have become standard in binary
time series cross-sectional regressions. As reported in the original article, the esti-
mated coefficient on the affinity score variable is negative and statistically signifi-
cant at the a¼.05 level. However, when working with time series data, failure to
account for temporal confounding can lead to misleading and overconfident infer-
ences (Beck, Katz, and Tucker 1998). To adjust for this, we follow the recommen-
dations of Carter and Signorino (2010) and include a cubic polynomial of the
number of years since the last dyadic dispute as a set of additional controls.
We find that after controlling for temporal dependence, affinity scores are not sta-
tistically significantly associated with the incidence of dyadic MIDs at the .05 level,
contrary to the findings reported in Oneal and Russett (1999) and Gartzke (2000).
However, when we replace affinity scores with the negative absolute difference in
the ideal points of both sides of each dyad, preference similarity becomes a statisti-
cally significant ( p< .05) predictor of reduced dispute propensity. Figure 5 shows
the predicted changes in MID probability that correspond to a comparable increase
in preference similarity for the affinity and ideal point models. The estimated effects
are on the same order of magnitude, but using ideal points increases the precision of
the estimated effect. Substituting ideal points for S scores also appreciably improves
model fit.12These results suggest that our proposed measure may be a more accurate
indicator of interstate preference similarity as well as one that is more robust to mod-
eling dynamics.
Conclusion
Votes in the UNGA contain valuable information about the preferences of states.
Most political science applications that take advantage of this fact distill preference
information via dyadic vote-agreement scores such as S scores. Unfortunately, such
scores can move dramatically due to changes in agenda even when the underlying
preferences do not change. They produce estimates that in some cases beggar belief,
implying, for example, that the United States and Russia today are more at odds than
the United States and Soviet Union ever were.448 Journal of Conflict Resolution 61(2)
We present a spatial theory IRT model that estimates national foreign policy pre-
ferences based on UN voting from 1946 to 2012. We identify preference change over
time by taking advantage of the fact that the UN voted on some resolutions in mul-
tiple years. Our estimates systematically identify widely understood foreign policy
consequences of regime changes within countries, such as the switch toward (and
away) from the United States when military (and left-wing) regimes take control
in Latin American countries. Moreover, the ideal point estimates correlate in
expected ways with democratization, financial liberalization, and government
ideology.
We end with two recommendations. First, scholars should be specific about what
coefficients on similarity indicators derived from UN votes mean. Scholars should
not refer to measures based on UN votes as assessments of ‘‘common interests’’ writ
large. These measures have nothing to say about whether two countries agree on how
to resolve a border conflict or regional issues. The UN deals with issues of global
importance. Thus, measures based on UN votes are only useful if we believe, theo-
retically, that a state’s position on global issues matters for the outcome under con-
sideration. If measures are based on all UN votes since World War II, there is a
relatively consistent underlying substantive dimension that dominates contestation.
We could estimate ideal points for subsets of issues, such as the Middle East, colo-
nialism, or votes, on which the United States has lobbied. Those could yield different
substantive results.
Second, scholars should approach dya dic measures such a s S scores with cau-
tion. We have shown that these yield impla usible results, such a s the United States
and Russia now more divided than the United States and the Soviet Union ever
were during the Cold War. Moreover, S s cores are very sensitive to annual agenda−0.030 −0.025 −0.020 −0.015 −0.010 −0.005 0.000

3. Signorino and Ritter offer a generalized version, but scholars use the one discussed here.
4. There are two studies that do this for limited numbers of votes or time frame: Voeten
(2004) and Mattes, Leeds, and Carroll (2015).
5. Grimmer (2010) uses a similar approach to identify direct quotation of US Senators’ press
releases in newspaper coverage.
6. We adjusted the threshold at which we manually inspected resolutions based on year.
Due to the poor printing of some of the earlier resolutions, optical character recognition
software imperfectly translat es the documents into text, lea ding to more errors. We also
eliminated budget and other annual resolutions that could clearly not have an identical
interpretation across years.
7. This is the R2from STATA’s xtreg procedure.
8. Note that these are averages. Some Middle East resolutions separate countries along
East–West lines very well.
9. Results available from the authors.
10. These covariates are the lower and higher levels of dyadic democracy (measured using
the Polity scale), a dyadic alliance indicator, geographic contiguity, per capita economic
growth, trade dependence, and the ratio of the stronger state’s military capability to the
weaker state’s military capability. The exact construction of these variables is detailed
in Oneal and Russett (1997).
11. Due to this modification, we have 18,303 dyad-year observations in our data set com-
pared to 17,910 reported in the study by Gartzke.
12. A lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) is preferred. The AIC for the model with the
ideal point measure is 4,239.8 compared to the affinity model’s AIC of 4,302.5.
