1 Introduction
In spite of the rapid growth of emerging markets, OECD markets are still, today, the
world’s largest (representing 66 % of the world GDP in 2011),
1providing key
outlets for goods exported from developing countries. How much access there is for
developing countries on OECD markets has been the subject of considerableattention from a policy angle (see e.g. Kee et al. 2009 and references therein). By
contrast, to our knowledge, not much has been written on the outcome—the overallevolution and composition of OECD imports. Yet, it matters whether they areopening up in the sense of letting more extra-OECD exporters in, or concentratingon a few ‘‘preferred’’ suppliers. Contestable OECD markets would make it easier forentrants to get a foothold; in contrast, if they exhibited strong incumbency
advantages, they could create a two-track world among extra-OECD exporters
(between countries that make it and countries that do not).
So far, a rapidly expanding literature has looked at the other side of the story,
namely how export diversiﬁcation interacts with economic development. Klingerand Lederman ( 2004 ) and Cadot et al. ( 2011 ) focus on product diversiﬁcation and
ﬁnd that diversiﬁcation evolves with income levels in a non-monotone way withpeaks at middle income levels, a pattern similar to what Imbs and Wacziarg ( 2003 )
found for production. Parteka ( 2010 ) contributes to this literature by showing that
the diversiﬁcation of exports along the economic development path is dependent on
the choice of concentration measures (absolute vs. relative). Hummels and Klenow(2005 ) account for the economic signiﬁcance of the goods and show that the
extensive margins of exports explain up to 60 % of cross-country export variation.Other papers have looked at the extensive margin deﬁned geographically instead ofproduct-wise. The ﬁrst paper in that vein was Evenett and Venables ( 2002 ), who
showed that about one-third of the export growth came from the expansion ofexisting exports to new markets. On the basis of a larger sample, Brenton and
Newfarmer ( 2007 ) found that the extensive margin accounted for only 19.6 % of
export growth; of that, 92 % came from the export of existing products to newmarkets. Two recent papers, Parteka and Tamberi ( 2012 ) and Jaimovich ( 2012 ), also
look at the import side. Parteka and Tamberi ( 2012 ), focusing on product
diversiﬁcation, carefully examine the evolution of import and export diversiﬁcation

along the economic development path. They ﬁnd a positive correlation between
countries’ GDP per capita and both import and export diversiﬁcation. Jaimovich(2012 ) studies geographic import diversiﬁcation and ﬁnds evidence for an increase
in imports source diversiﬁcation along the growth path.
Another strand of the trade literature, going back to the work of Hanson ( 1996 ),
has emphasized the formation of regional production networks by multinationalﬁrms. According to this literature, a country’s exports may be determined by theoutsourcing decisions of multinationals based in other countries. Anecdotalevidence also suggests that it is retailers who decide which foreign suppliers (andhence countries) are included in cross-border supply chains. Thus, for producerslocated in developing countries, export opportunities are, at least partly, driven by
the policies of large buyers in OECD countries. If those buyers decide to
concentrate on a few suppliers in order, say, to simplify logistics or quality-controlprocesses, opportunities will be fewer for entrants at every level of productivity andtrade costs. Put differently, given the continued importance of OECD markets fordeveloping-country exports (in 2011, exports towards the OECD account for 58 %of developing countries total exports), it seems difﬁcult to understand howdeveloping-country exports evolve without looking at how OECD imports evolve.
Understanding the origin and diversity of imports is also relevant for OECD
countries. The literature on endogenous growth (e.g., Romer 1987 ), technological
spillovers (e.g., Coe and Helpman 1995 ; Keller 2004 ) as well as recent empirical
works on ﬁrm level data (e.g., Halpern and Koren 2011 ; Kasahara and Rodrigue
2008 ; Goldberg et al. 2010 ; Bas and Strauss-Kahn forthcoming; Aristei et al. 2013 )
show the importance of an increase in the number and diversity of importedintermediate inputs in raising productivity as well as product and export scope.Broda and Weinstein ( 2006 ) also show that increasing imports diversity enhances
aggregate welfare though a decrease in the price index. These strands of literature
do not however focus on the dynamic of the geographical sources of imports. This is
what we set out to do in this paper.

We posit that OECD buyers are in a continuous search for best quality suppliers
from developing countries. Our model, a simple ﬁnite-horizon version of a classictwo-arm bandit problem where buyers screen suppliers for quality and toss them outwhen they under-perform, captures this feature. The model predicts that diversi-ﬁcation happens by ‘‘bouts’’, or temporary episodes, during which OECD buyerssearch for high-quality suppliers. Each diversiﬁcation episode is followed by a
phase of re-concentration on the best performers, until those fail (which happens
stochastically), triggering new search phases. Finally, the model suggests that withan increasing number of suppliers the overall trend is an increased diversiﬁcationacross time.
What we have in mind is a story where OECD buyers test suppliers from
different developing countries where least developed countries (LDCs) differ intheir exports quality. We identify a supplier as a country and believe quality of a
2As mentioned above Jaimovich ( 2012 ) studies geographic import diversiﬁcation. We add to this paper
by focusing on the OECD as importers and most importantly by providing and testing a model wherequality search leads to speciﬁc form of geographic import diversiﬁcation over time.OECD imports 3

trade relationship has a country speciﬁc dimension. This conjecture is in line with a
recent strand of trade literature which associates a product variety to a product-country pairs (e.g., Feenstra 1994 ; Broda and Weinstein 2006 ; Goldberg et al.
2010 ). Several arguments support the view that the probability of non-performing in
export markets differs across developing countries. First, as emphasized byHausmann and Rodrik ( 2003 ), there is an uncertainty about what a country can be
good at producing. Similarly, as revealed in Djankov et al. ( 2010 ), countries differ
in their ability to export products in due time. The average delay before shippinggoods varies greatly across LDCs with an average of 47 days for African countries(and a maximum of 116 days for Central African Republic) and of 24 days for EastAsian countries. As stated in the paper, long time delays are likely to be associated
with more uncertainty about success of the trade relationship. Suppliers in countries
with long delays are of lower quality. Rauch and Watson ( 2003 ) use the ISO 9000
certiﬁcation as a measure of lower quality of management across countries andshow that the rate of ISO 9000 is much lower in LDCs than in developed countries(DCs). Quality of management may indeed be necessary to provide internationalquality and delivery standards in OECD markets. The rate of ISO 9000 variesgreatly across developing countries. Following Rauch and Watson’s ( 2003 )
methodology we ﬁnd for example that in 2000, China has ﬁve times more ISO
9000 certiﬁcates per industrial workers than Morocco and 40 times more than
Bangladesh while Turkey or Brazil report about 3 times more certiﬁcates thanChina.
3Finally, working at the country level and using different measures of
quality, Hallak and Schott ( 2011 ) and Khandelwal ( 2010 ) ﬁnd substantial
differences in exports quality across countries.
Using a very large database of OECD imports at the 5-digit level Standard
International Trade Classiﬁcation (SITC) since 1963, we test the model’s basicpredictions by looking at the evolution of unit values during re-concentration
episodes and at how the volatility of concentration indices varies across products
types, taking the variation in unit values as a proxy for quality heterogeneity.
4We
ﬁnd, as predicted by the model, that re-concentration, when it happens, is associatedwith a risein unit values. That is, when buyers re-concentrate, they do so on higher-
priced (and hence presumably higher-quality) suppliers rather than on the mostprice-competitive. We also ﬁnd that concentration indices are more volatile, overtime, for products whose quality (as proxied by unit values) is more heterogeneousacross suppliers. Finally, consistent with an extension of our model, we provide
evidence of an overall diversiﬁcation in OECD import’s sources of supplies
3The number of ISO 9000 certiﬁcates comes from the ISO Survey of ISO 9000 and ISO 14000
certiﬁcates—Tenth cycle provided by the International Organization of Standardization. We obtain datafor industrial employment combining data on share of industrial employment in total employment, shareof employment in population and population from the World Development Indicators (World Bank2011 ).
4Whether unit values are good proxies of product quality is disputable. Differences in unit value may
reﬂect both changes in product quality and/or ﬁrms’ markups. In our context however, higher markupscould easily be associated with performing suppliers as buyers keep high unit-price suppliers only if theyare reliable. Note that unit values are still widely used in the literature discussing issues related to productquality (see for example Kugler and Verhoogen 2012 ; Manova and Zhang 2012 ).4 O. Cadot et al.

(geographically) at the product level. This is reﬂected in a decreasing concentration
index and a rising number of export sources over the 1963–2006 period.5
As in Rauch and Watson ( 2003 ), we design a model which presents a partnership
between developed countries buyers and developing countries suppliers in a state of
uncertainty on the ability of suppliers to honor their exports. We share the sameconcern of understanding the trade relationship between DC buyers and LDCsuppliers. In Rauch and Watson’ s model, search for suppliers is costly and buyersmay start with small orders in order to test suppliers’ ability to fulﬁll theirrequirement in quality and delivery. Buyers may chose to end a relationship in favorof a newly discovered supplier. Our focus is not on the size of the transactions buton the number of transactions. DC buyers test numerous suppliers and keep only the
performing ones. Our views are not incompatible: when testing many suppliers,
likely orders are small. Our ﬁnding that buyers, when they re-concentrate, preferhigh-priced products is in line with Baldwin and Harrigan ( 2011 ). They show that
unit values are positively related to countries’ distances suggesting that high-quality/high-price products are the most competitive (as these goods can bear thehigh transportation cost implied by long distances).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2sets up a simple model of supplier
screening in the presence of adverse selection. Section 3explores empirically the
model’s implications for patterns of concentration and diversiﬁcation by analyzing
the temporary movement and overall trend in OECD imports. Section 4concludes.
2 A simple model of quality search
We know little about the forces that drive the diversiﬁcation/concentration of OECD
buyers on speciﬁc sets of geographic suppliers. In the spirit of Rauch and Watson(2003 ), we posit that OECD buyers, in search for quality, test suppliers and
concentrate on the best. As the set of suppliers expands and buyers continuesampling, diversiﬁcation takes place. In order to explore this conjecture, we ﬁrstbuild a very simple, stripped-down model of quality search. This model is a ﬁnite-horizon version of a classic two-arm bandit problem in the spirit of Rothschild
(1974 ) and Bar-Isaac ( 2003 ). As usual in reputation models (e.g., Leland 1979 ;
Tirole 1996 ), there are one type of buyers and two types of sellers with exogenous
quality draws.
7We then introduce additional assumptions on buyer tastes and
5This trend in diversiﬁcation reversed itself in recent years; we show however in Sect. 3that this is
entirely explained by the rising share of Chinese products in OECD imports. Concentration indices keepon decreasing monotonically when China is excluded.
6Baldwin and Harrigan ( 2011 ) develop a general equilibrium model based on Melitz ( 2003 ) with a taste
for quality so that the lowest prices goods are not necessarily the most competitive.
7As in the incomplete contract literature (see Antra `s2011 for a survey in the context of international
trade), there is some uncertainty about the quality of the relationship between buyers and suppliers. Ourfocus is however different. In our work, the organizational form of the transaction (outsourcing orintegration) is not the central question and termination does not incur any cost. Our model is betterunderstood as outsourcing contracts where buyers shop around for the best suppliers rather than buyersand sellers adapting contracts in order to improve the transaction.OECD imports 5

expanding supplier pool potentially interfering with the basic quality-search
mechanism.
2.1 Baseline model
In this section we explore how supplier concentration is affected by informational
considerations in the presence of a selection problem. Consider a 3-period settingwhere, in each period, a buyer needs to procure two units of a product from eitherone or two suppliers called XandY. Each supplier has the capacity to provide either
one or two units, as the buyer wishes, at a constant price. Suppliers are of unknownquality, with a per-period probability of providing a non-defective product equal to
k
Gfor a good type and kB\kGfor a bad type (that is, the arrival of defective
products follows an independent Bernoulli process for each supplier). Any supplier
may fail, the probability of failure is however higher in a low-quality country (a badtype) where delivery is long and uncertain, management is poor and the like. The
buyer knows k
GandkBbut not the type of each supplier, and assigns a prior
probability p1on a good type in the initial period. Let p1be the buyer’s proﬁt on a
non-defective product and p0\p1on a defective one, payoffs being additive, and let
fi¼1 designate the event that the product is non-defective. Let
/C22pG¼kGp1þ1/C0kG/C0/C1
p0ð1Þ
be the expected proﬁt from buying from a good type and similarly for /C22pB. In periods
2 and 3, the buyer revises his beliefs about the quality of each supplier on the basis
of information (defective product or not) he obtained by dealing with them (if he
did) in the previous period.

be the revised probability that supplier iis a good type in t, based on information
from period t-1.
The buyer faces two sequential-sampling (or stopping-time) problems on two
independent stochastic processes, but the decisions are not independent because
sampling on one has consequences for the optimal stopping time on the other. The
problem is thus potentially very complicated, but the limitation to two suppliers andthree periods keeps it tractable.
8Consider the period-3 problem, and let V3be the
buyer’s expected proﬁt. Suppose that he dealt with both suppliers in period 2. Thenin period 3 he buys both units from the best, so

independent processes is known in the statistical-decision literature as a ‘‘multi-armed bandit’’ problem.One strategy, called ‘‘epsilon-ﬁrst’’, consists of a sampling (exploratory) phase during which several‘‘levers’’ are tried, after which the experimenter sticks to the lever for which he has the most optimisticbelief based on information gathered during the sampling phase.6 O.

In period 1, ﬁnally, the prior being the same on both suppliers, both are used,

respectively.
Clearly, the ‘‘interim’’ payoff collected in period 2 is higher, in expected value,
with one supplier than with two, since in the former case the buyer buys only fromthe best whereas in the latter he carries both along. However, the expected period-3payoff is, as noted, higher when two suppliers are kept in period 2 because theinformation generated has a value. Thus, there is a trade off between concentratingon the most efﬁcient supplier and keeping several in order to ‘‘test’’ them.
What does the value of the information depend on? Suppose that, at the end of
period 1, the buyer kept only one supplier, the one with the highest probability ofbeing good, and suppose (without loss of generality) that it was supplier x. Letting I

stand for the information available at the beginning of period 2, the conditional
expectation of the period-3 gain is (see ‘‘ Appendix ’’):

be the probability that ywould perform better than x
in period 3, given that he performed worse so far, if we could observe both in action

Thus, the value of the information depends on three multiplicative terms. The ﬁrst is
the probability that a good draw for the second-best supplier would reverse theOECD imports 7
123
ranking of beliefs. In a 3-period model, sampling stops in period one and concen-
tration has to take place.9By contrast, with more periods a reversal of beliefs is
possible, and so, depending on the parameters ( kandp) continued sampling is
optimal. In Sect. 2.2below, a multi-period simulation of the model provides evi-
dence of this phenomenon.
The second term is that in square brackets. Observe that it is decreasing in px
2; the
better is the ‘‘front-runner’’ supplier ( x) the less there is to gain from an eventual
reversal of beliefs. In our 3-period setting, this doesn’t say much, but in a multi-period setting it would have a potentially important consequence on which we willreturn.
The third term, ﬁnally, is the difference in expected gains between a good and a
bad supplier, which can be written as
/C22p
G/C0/C22pB¼kG/C0kB/C0/C1
p1/C0p0/C0/C1
: ð9Þ
The ﬁrst factor on the RHS of ( 9) is the difference between the prospects of a good
and a bad supplier, a measure of their heterogeneity; the second is the effect ofquality differences on proﬁt, a measure of the industry’s characteristics (quality-sensitivity). Thus, the value of information, which in our setting drives the searchfor quality, is increasing in their heterogeneity and in the sensitivity of buyers toproduct quality.
2.2 More than three periods
With more periods, the revision of beliefs (i.e. the difference between posterior and
prior from one period to the next) becomes smaller over time as beliefs approachasymptotically zero or one, but how fast the process of revision converges depends,of course, on the parameters of the two processes. If the two distributions (good andbad) have similar parameters, it takes, in expectation, more time to tell apart the twotypes, which requires longer sampling. Figure 1illustrates how the rate of
convergence varies with the parameters. In the LHS panel the two distributions are
characterized by sharply different parameters and beliefs converge after twentyperiods; in the RHS panel, the two distributions have similar parameters and thebeliefs take almost a hundred periods to converge.
In the LHS case, positions tend to lock in fairly quickly. In the RHS case, longer
sampling is needed to tell apart the two suppliers; however, note that the difference
in expected returns ( /C22p
G/C0/C22pB), which is part of the value of the information, is also
smaller, so the truth takes longer to appear but it matters less. Observe also that in
the RHS panel, around iteration #20, supplier xhas accumulated so many bad draws
9In our 3-period model, the event that py
2\px
2implies that yhad a defect in period 1 while xdid not.
Then, if fortunes are reversed in period 2 ( xhas a defect while yhas not), it is easily veriﬁed that
posteriors at the beginning of period 3 will be just equal for xandy. So, at best, the buyer will be
indifferent between xandyin period 3. In ( 8), we have thus /y¼0 and, given the multiplicative form of
X, the value of the information is nil: There is no reason to keep on sampling after period 1. In a 4-period
framework, at the cost of tedious algebra it is (relatively) straightforward to show that a reversal of beliefsis possible with two successive lucky draws on yand two unlucky ones on x, and so, continued sampling
(using both suppliers) can be optimal in period 2.8 O. Cadot et al.
123
and supplier yso many good draws that the buyer is ‘‘almost certain’’ that yis of the
good type, even though this belief is false (observe the dotted curve ( y) approaching
one between iterations #20 and #40). Going back to ( 8), we see that

that is, when the buyer becomes ‘‘almost certain’’ that his currently preferred
supplier is of the good type, the value of information goes to zero and he stopssampling. If that were the case in the RHS panel of Fig. 1(where the preferred
supplier around iteration 20 is y) the part of the long-dashed curve lying to the right
of the stopping time would be censored. The remaining incumbent (here y) would
then be the sole supplier until sufﬁcient evidence accumulates to convince the buyerthat he had bet on the wrong horse (in the ﬁgure, that becomes clear after aboutiteration 60 and the posterior on yﬁnally converges to zero around iteration 90). The
buyer would turn to the alternative supplier only when his revised opinion on the
incumbent drops back below the evicted supplier’s last posterior.
10
The model thus implies that concentration, when it occurs, is on high-quality
products. It also suggests that periods of diversiﬁcation are followed by periods ofre-concentration and that volatility in the concentration of imports is higher forgoods that are more heterogeneous in terms of quality. In order to shed light on the

10Note that in this setup there can be no ‘‘informational cascade’’. An informational cascade
(Bikhchandani et al. 1992 ) can take place when a sequence of actors make binary decisions on a singe
issue (say, buying or selling a stock) based on a noisy signal about the correct decision and on theobserved behaviour of past players. Each player forms his own belief based on a weighted average of hissignal and past players’ actions, with weight on the latter that increases with the number of past players.Bikhchandani et al. show that there exists a critical number nsuch that, if nplayers observe the wrong
signal and act accordingly, the ( n?1)st will discard his own signal and follow the crowd. From then on,
the herd behaviour cannot be reversed. Our setup is different because the buyer is repeatedly gettinginformation about his supplier, whereas in an informational cascade the individual experimenter gets onlyone signal that he compares with the actions of other (past) players.OECD imports 9

assumptions: (i) buyers have a taste for diversity, and (ii) the number of suppliers isexpanding.

Suppose, without loss of generality, that the preferred supplier is x. Replacing p/C3

3in (3), it is easily veriﬁed that, for a¼1, keeping one supplier is optimal (this is
the benchmark case without a taste for diversity). However, as agoes down, the sign
of the inequality is eventually reversed and the taste for diversity comes to dominatethe selection effect. This is illustrated in Fig. 2where V
32;1ðÞ andV32;2ðÞ are
shown as functions of r¼1=1/C0a ðÞ , the elasticity of substitution between the two
suppliers, for assumed parameter values. For values of rbelow 4.3, the taste for
diversity dominates and keeping both suppliers is optimal; for values above 4.3, theselection effect dominates and keeping only one supplier is optimal.
What does this mean for our model? Essentially that the taste for diversity acts as
a counterforce to the selection effect, generating situations where the Bayesianupdate of beliefs designates one supplier as preferable to others but the buyernevertheless keeps several because he values diversity.
2.3.2 Entry of new suppliers
The number of suppliers would enlarge if trade costs were coming down or if
productivity was rising exogenously among producers in a pool of potentialsuppliers with heterogeneous productivity levels as in Helpman et al. ( 2008 ).
Several empirical studies support this increase in the number of potential suppliers.10 O. Cadot et al.
123
Schott ( 2004 ) shows that the number of LDC suppliers for a given product has on
average increased over time. Cadot et al. ( 2011 ) show that, over 1989–2005, on
average each country has introduced 50–200 new export products. Similarly, using a
more restrictive deﬁnition of new products, Klinger and Lederman ( 2004 ) found that
1,710 new product-country pairs were introduced in the 1990s (with a maximum of160 for Indonesia).
11Suppliers would then appear progressively, creating scope for
diversiﬁcation of supplier sources at the extensive margin. As before, the repetitionof transactions with incumbents would asymptotically reveal their quality, butstrings of bad draws would always be possible even for good types, and theirreplacement would then set the clock back to zero for the new ones. With severalentrants all characterized by similar priors, buyers would start by sampling all of
them like at the beginning of our 3-period model, subsequently concentrating on the
best. Episodes of diversiﬁcation would be followed by episodes of concentration.
Thus, informational considerations in the multi-period setup suggest that, in
sectors where quality matters and is not standard across suppliers, entrants will ﬁndit hard to unseat incumbents as long as those perform well. But, with stochasticquality draws, incumbents are bound to fail 1 day or another. When they failsufﬁciently severely (i.e. with a string of bad draws in a row), a window ofopportunity opens up for entrants, ushering in a new phase of diversiﬁcation, quality
search, and ultimate re-concentration on the best performers.
12With an increasing
number of suppliers, the number of best performers chosen as importers increasesover time. The buyers’ taste for diversity reinforces this effect. There isdiversiﬁcation. What the model shows is that diversiﬁcation will happen by

11Note that these studies consider new products at the HS6 level. The number of new producers is
obviously much larger.
12Failure may also be triggered endogenously by moral hazard if incumbents slacken the monitoring
effort as time passes. For a reputational model with both selection and moral hazard, see e.g. Laeven andPerotti ( 2001 ).OECD imports 11

‘‘bouts’’, as a result of repeated failures in established buyer–supplier relationships,
rather than as a continuous phenomenon.
Whereas the taste-for-diversity forces generate maximum diversiﬁcation at all
times (an essentially static prediction), quality search suggests alternating phases of
diversiﬁcation and re-concentration. The existence of these phases is implied onlyby the informational features of the model. Thus, volatility in concentration levelscan be taken as a hallmark of informational phenomena and it depends on theheterogeneity of quality levels across suppliers.
13Our model suggests three testable
propositions that we empirically explore in the next section: (i) If driven by qualitysearch buyers will, at the end of each search phase, concentrate on the best supplier.(ii) Time-wise volatility in the concentration of imports is higher for goods that are
more heterogeneous in terms of quality. (iii) With an increasing number of
suppliers, new search phases are likely to entail higher diversiﬁcation over time.
3 Quality search and diversiﬁcation: empirical evidence
3.1 Concentration index and data
We measure, product by product ( k), the geographical concentration of OECD
country i’s imports in tacross origin countries. Our measure is the Theil’s entropy
index (Theil 1972 ) given by:

andnkis the total number of countries with the capability to export good k.14Our
baseline deﬁnition of the set of potential exporters, nk, which is time-invariant, is the
set of all countries having exported good ktosome destination in the world (not
necessarily OECD countries) at least two consecutive years in a row over the sample
13However, supply shocks knocking out suppliers periodically could also create exogenous volatility at
the extensive margin. This is to be kept in mind in the empirical exploration that follows, as baselinevolatility is unlikely to be exactly zero.
14Parteka ( 2010 ) found very high correlations between the different measures of concentration (Theil
and Herﬁndahl indices are correlated at 0.95). Results in her paper do not depend on the choice of theconcentration index. We re-run all speciﬁcations of the present paper using the Herﬁndahl index andfound similar results as the ones presented here. These results are available upon request. We decided not
to use the Gini coefﬁcient because of the issues associated with this concentration index. The Gini
coefﬁcient is a numerical representation of the degree of concentration and represents the distancebetween the Lorentz curve and the 45 /C176line (egalitarian distribution). There are two issues with Gini
coefﬁcients. First, they place more weight on changes in the middle part of the distribution. If a transferoccurs from a larger number of exporters to a smaller number of exporters, it has a greater effect on theGini if these numbers of exporters are near the middle rather than at the extremes of the distribution.Second, if the Lorentz curves cross, it is impossible to summarize the distribution in a single statisticwithout introducing value judgements. While studying concentration of import across time these issueshould be relevant. Herﬁndahl and Theil indices are robust to these sensitivity issues [on this, see Sen(1997 )].12 O. Cadot et al.

period.15We impose the requirement of two consecutive years of exports instead of
just one in order to ensure that the exporter is a successful one (Besedes and Prusa2006a ,bshow that 2 years is the median duration of export spells; only 1 year
might signal failure rather than the capacity to export). This deﬁnition has the
advantage of being time- and importer-invariant (the latter matters for the part ofour analysis where we disaggregate OECD imports by importing country).
As shown in Cadot et al. ( 2011 ), the presence of logarithm in the Theil index is
not an issue for ‘‘zero’’ trade ﬂows as at the limit, and by L’Ho ˆpital’s rule, ‘‘zero’’
trade ﬂows do not contribute to the measure of concentration. Our index ofconcentration captures both actions at the extensive and intensive margin withoutdistinction.
16In order to explore action at the extensive margin, we also consider the
simple number of exporters of good kto the OECD country iint,Nber ikt.
Our data is COMTRADE import data for OECD countries (either taken as a bloc
or disaggregated by importer) at the product level.17Our preferred product
classiﬁcation is the 5-digit level SITC data (using the backwards classiﬁcation—revision 1). The alternative, HS6, is more disaggregated (with 4,990–5,016 linesdepending on the year against 1,158–1,300 for 5-digit level SITC), but the sampleperiod is longer with SITC, which also underwent fewer revisions. In terms ofcountry coverage, 5-digit level SITC data covers 253 countries and territories
between 1962 and 2006 (44 years); HS6 coverage is nominally available starting
1988, but with only 12 countries (9 of which are OECD members) expandinggradually to 116 countries in 1995 and 140 in 2006.
18
15In order to calculate the Theil index and capture the evolution in geographic import concentration, we
need to deﬁne a potential number of source countries than is constant over time. In effect, if we let nkvary
over time, (say by making it equivalent to the number of countries that export a speciﬁc product eachyear), we cannot disentangle concentration/diversiﬁcation on actual suppliers from changes in theuniverse of potential suppliers. For example, an increase in the Theil index may be caused by eitherconcentration of imports on fewer sources or an increase in the number of potential sources. Our modelhowever suggests that concentration occurs because buyers select the best suppliers after testing them. Ifn
kvaries, we may observe concentration while the number of actual suppliers does not change, which
would be misleading. Similarly, the geographic diversiﬁcation of imports across time could results from
the elimination of some countries from the set of potential suppliers. The OECD is not more diversiﬁed in
the sense that it tests extra supply sources. As we are interested in the importers selections of sourcecountries and its link with unit values, we do not want our concentration index to be modiﬁed by changeson the supplier side.
16Cadot et al. ( 2011 ) show that the Theil index can be decomposed into between- and within-groups
components with a partition of lines into active and inactive ones which result in a perfect mapping withthe extensive and intensive margins of trade.
17The deﬁnition of OECD countries used in this paper includes the 29 countries that belonged to the
OECD in 2006, i.e. Australia, Austria, Belgium-Luxembourg, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark,Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Spain, Korea, Mexico, theNetherlands, New-Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Switzerland,Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
18We do not believe that the level of disaggregation (SITC 5-digit or HS6) matters for our analysis:
although Theil variations may results from composition effect at the sub-product level, such variationsrandomly correlate with product unit value. In order to confront our main ﬁndings to the choice ofdisaggregation of the database, we re-run our main regression (Table 1) on the sub-sample of SITC codes
that correspond to only one (alternatively two or less) HS6 lines. Results are similar to the ones obtainwith the full SITC database and are available upon request.OECD imports 13

3.2 Concentration and quality search: testing for ‘‘bouts’’
Proposition 1 involves unobservable quality heterogeneity. We approximate quality
by unit values, of which we calculate import-weighted averages for each OECDimporter, good and year. If re-concentration, when it takes place, is on the bestperformers, we expect positive year-on-year changes in the Theil index to correlatewith positive changes in the average unit value of imports. The average unit value’srise is a composition effect, as buyers concentrate on high-quality suppliers. Thus, a
straightforward test would consist of regressing, on a panel of OECD
importer 9product pairs (recall that we are looking at concentration across source
countries), ﬁrst differences in Theil indices on ﬁrst differences in average unitvalues across sources, expecting a positive correlation. However, we can sharpenthis test using a key corollary.
The corollary is that the effect is asymmetric: whereas the model predicts that
unit values should rise during concentration phases, it is silent on the evolution of
unit values during diversiﬁcation phases. For instance, at the beginning of a search
phase (i.e. diversiﬁcation), new tested suppliers may be of higher quality than the
best selected supplier of the preceding sampling phase. In this case, qualityincreases during diversiﬁcation. This corollary can be used to sharpen our test of themodel’s base prediction. To do this, we replace annual ﬁrst differences in unitvalues as a regressor ( DUV
ikt) by two interaction terms deﬁning two distinct
regimes. In regime 1 (concentration), ﬁrst differences in unit values are interactedwith a dummy equal to one if concentration is rising ( DTheil
ikt[0). In regime 2
(diversiﬁcation), ﬁrst differences in unit values are interacted with a dummy equal
to one if concentration is decreasing ( DTheil iktB0). Table 1gives regression
results for this test and a variant where the regimes are restricted to DTheil ikt[0.1
andDTheil iktB0.1 respectively (this 0.1 threshold corresponding to the top 25 % of
the re-concentration phases in terms of DTheil ikt).
The ﬁrst two columns of Table 1conﬁrm the model’s base prediction. Positive
year-on-year changes in the Theil index correlate with positive changes in unitvalues, and this result holds for a large set of ﬁxed effects. That is, when there is re-concentration, it takes place on higher-quality suppliers. As shown in columns (3)
and (4), this positive impact becomes stronger when restricted to deeper re-
concentration phases, i.e. for phases where ﬁrst differences in the Theil index areabove 0.1. Strikingly, no signiﬁcant correlation is found in diversiﬁcation phases.We tested the robustness of this result by running the same estimation using theannual ﬁrst difference in the numbers of partners of country iin good kas the
dependent variable (with a threshold still corresponding to the top 25 % of the re-concentration phases in terms of DNber
ikt). As shown in columns (5) and (6), results
are similar to those presented in the 2 preceding columns.19
Finally, a similar regression using import-weighted averages of the exporters’
GDP per capita instead of unit values gives a qualitatively similar result, suggesting
19Note that importer-product as well importers ﬁxed effects control for late appearance of some OECD
countries within the database (e.g., we have data for Poland, the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republicstarting in the early 90’s). Year ﬁxed effects control for exogenous shocks that may affect several OECDcountries on their sourcing behaviour alike.14 O. Cadot et al.

that when re-concentration takes place, it is on suppliers located in higher-income
countries, which tend to produce higher-quality goods (on this, see Hallak andSchott 2011 ). The evidence in Table 1is thus suggestive of a quality-search process
rather than a price-search one (in a price-search model, the search phase would
settle on the lowest-price supplier).
We now turn to Proposition 2, which says that the alternating phases of quality
screening and re-concentration will be more pronounced for products whose qualitymatters and where it is not standardized across suppliers. That is, the time-wisevolatility of concentration should correlate with the dispersion of quality acrosssuppliers. In order to test for this, we measure the time-wise volatility ofconcentration at the (importer 9product) level by the normalized standard
deviation of the Theil index over the entire sample period. We approximate the
dispersion of quality across suppliers, also at the (importer 9product) level, by the
standard deviation of unit values across time and exporters. Note that, in so doing,we reduce the sample’s dimensionality from three (importer 9product 9time) to
two (importer 9product), i.e. we collapse our panel into a cross-section of
(importer 9product) pairs.
Before we turn to regression results, let us take a look at the relationship for the
1,299 products between the time-wise volatility of concentration and the variability
of unit values for an average OECD country’ imports (i.e. disregarding heteroge-
neity between importing countries).
20The plain line in Fig. 3is generated by
regressing standard deviations of Theil indices on standard deviations of unit-valuesusing pooled OLS with White-corrected standard errors.
21The broken curve in the
same ﬁgure is generated by running a ‘‘smoother’’ (non-parametric) regressioninstead of OLS. Non-parametric regression imposes no functional form and istherefore well suited to the exploration of data with no pre-determined relationshipbetween variables.
22Both show a positive relationship between the volatility of
concentration over time (the amplitude of the alternating diversiﬁcation/re-
concentration phases) and the variability of unit values across time and suppliers(the extent of the selection problem).
We run a parametric test exploiting cross-importer variation in our base
relationship (although the time dimension of the panel is still collapsed by theconstruction of our volatility variables). In Table 2, the normalized standard errors
of the Theil index and unit values are computed using both the whole sample(column 1) and the sub-sample of (importer 9product) pairs with at least 30 non-
missing observations over 1963–2006 (column 2). Results presented in Table 2
conﬁrm the positive correlation between volatility in concentration indices andvariability in product quality. As shown in columns (3) and (4), our results are alsorobust to the use of standard deviations in the numbers of partners as the dependentvariable instead of standard deviations in Theil indices.
20For every product, Theil and unit value volatilities correspond to simple averages over countries
belonging to the OECD.
2195 % conﬁdence interval is also reported.
22Non-parametric ‘‘smoother’ ’ regression consists on re-estimating the regression for overlapping
samples centered on each observation.16 O. Cadot et al.
123
Thus by and large, results are as suggested by the model. Re-concentration
phases occur on goods of better quality and the volatility of concentration indices ishigher for products with high-quality heterogeneity. This indeed suggests alternat-ing periods of diversiﬁcation and concentration in search for quality.
3.3 Measuring overall geographical import concentration
We now examine whether there is an overall diversiﬁcation trend over the entire
period. Our set up suggests that with entry of new suppliers and a taste for variety,

123
OECD imports become globally more diversiﬁed (even if this diversiﬁcation
happens by bouts). We test this conjecture by looking at the overall evolution of theconcentration index and the number of imported products over the years 1963–2006.
Figure 4shows the evolution of simple averages over all products imported by
OECD countries at tof our Theil index as well as the number of products. Panel a)
shows Theil indices calculated using all OECD imports (i.e. imports from allpartners, including intra-OECD ones) as well as using only extra-OECD partners(i.e. developing countries). A strong diversiﬁcation trend until 2002 is shown by theTheil index when accounting for all imports, after which the indices rise until 2006,the sample’s last year. The diversiﬁcation is less pronounced while excluding intra-OECD trade and it re-concentrates after 1990. Between 1999 and 2006, this Theil
index rises by 7.4 %, almost three times its coefﬁcient of variation over the period
1963–1999. Panel b) looks at the extensive margin by showing the evolution ofimport-weighted averages, across 5-digit level SITC lines, of the number of non-OECD exporters to the OECD over the sample period.
23
The trend reversal is unmistakable as far as the concentration index for imports
from non-OECD countries is concerned. However, it takes place quite late in thesample period. In order to verify whether it is statistically signiﬁcant, and that it isnot a pure composition effect between products (i.e. a sectoral shift away from
widely-procured products toward narrowly-procured ones), we now turn to
regressions of concentration indices on time and its square using ﬁxed (product)effects. Results are shown in Table 3. Column (1) shows results with concentration
indices (the dependent variable) calculated over all imports (including intra-OECD)whereas column (2) presents results for extra-OECD imports only (a moreinteresting measure from a developmental perspective). The within estimatorconﬁrms the convex time trend, as both time and its square are signiﬁcant withopposite signs.
Columns (4) and (5) of Table 3report the results of ﬁxed-effects regressions of
the number of exporters to the OECD on time and its square. Column (5) includes aspeciﬁc time trend for the post-2000 period. The extensive margin as measured bythe average number of source countries does not seem to show the same kind oftrend reversal that we observed in the concentration indices, which pick up action atboth the extensive and intensive margins. Figure 4shows a decline in the rate of
increase in the number of exporters to the OECD (the trade-weighted averagenumber of suppliers per product stabilizes over 100). For many products, this is
likely to exhaust the pool of potential exporters, so a leveling off is to be expected.
This is reﬂected by the negative coefﬁcient on Post 2000. This inﬂexion is howevernot strong enough to reverse the trend. The observed re-concentration of OECDimports thus seems to be entirely caused by action at the intensive margin.
In order to explore further what might be driving the apparent re-concentration of
OECD imports, we now decompose OECD imports by importing country andconstruct a three-dimensional panel whose unit of observation (the basis for thecalculation of our concentration indices) is a product imported by an OECD country
23Figures including all suppliers and using simple averages of number of exporters to OECD at the
product (SITC4) level are very similar to the one presented here and are available upon request.18 O. Cadot et al.

in a year (a triplet importer 9product 9year). Looking at things this way allows
us to look for another type of composition effects where more concentrated OECDcountries increase their relative share of total OECD imports. Regression results areshown in Column (3) and (6). Several observations emerge. First, the re-concentration apparent in the Theil index seems robust to the introduction of ﬁxed
effects by importer 9product pair. The news comes from the extensive margin,
where not only the square term on time preserves the monotonicity of diversiﬁcationbut even the post-2000 time trend no longer indicates a trend inﬂexion in the verylast years. The disappearance of the trend inﬂexion suggests that it resulted from acomposition effect between importers as described above.
To sum up, the observed re-concentration is robust to the decomposition of
OECD imports by importing country. However, as results on the number ofexporters show, it does not occur at the extensive margin, all of the action being at
the intensive margin.
Considering the rising importance of OECD trade with China over the last
decade, we must control for the role that China may play in that re-concentration. Incolumn (7) of Table 3the coefﬁcient on time squared loses its signiﬁcance when
China is excluded from the sample, suggesting that China is indeed driving theobserved re-concentration. Using our SITC data for China we calculated thecontribution of the intensive and extensive margin to China-OECD imports growthover the 1963–2006 period. While in the early years (1963–1975) the extensive
margin accounted for about 35 % of China-OECD imports growth, this share shrank
to almost zero in the 1993–2006 period. This conﬁrms that the increasedconcentration of OECD imports on China occurs at the intensive margin: In recentyears, no new product line opened between China and its OECD trade partners.
Thus, although their imports are increasingly concentrating on Chinese products,
OECD countries continue to open new imports lines with extra-OECD countries.That is, China’s expanding exports to the OECD do not seem (yet) to crowd out theNumber of exporters Theil index

entry of new exporter/product pairs on OECD markets. Overall, excluding China,
OECD imports are becoming more diversiﬁed across time as predicted by ourquality search model with an increasing number of potential suppliers.
4 Concluding remarks
Looking at the evolution of OECD imports at a high degree of disaggregation (over
a thousand product lines) over the forty-year period where data is available, we ﬁndstriking evidence of geographical diversiﬁcation at the product level. That is, OECDcountries have been sourcing each of their imported products from an increasingly
large pool of suppliers. We also ﬁnd evidence of a geographical re-concentration of
imports in the last 5 years or so, but this trend reversal is entirely attributable to thegrowing share of China in OECD imports. Put together with Besedes and Prusa’s(2006a ,b) ﬁndings of high churning rates among exporters, our results suggest that
OECD markets seem to be increasingly contestable for developing-countryexporters, at least at the source-country level.
As for the drivers of diversiﬁcation versus re-concentration, we ﬁnd that when
temporary geographical concentration takes place, it tends to be on higher-priced
national varieties. It is also more volatile for those goods which may be highly
differentiated quality-wise where quality presumably matters more and is moreheterogeneous across suppliers. Put together, these observations lend support to amodel of quality search by OECD buyers generating alternating periods ofconcentration and diversiﬁcation, discussed in Sect. 2of this paper. Our quality-
search approach suggests that the contestability of OECD markets varies across timeand products, with periods of closed doors, characterized by strong incumbencyadvantages, alternating with periods of open door, characterized by contestability.
In terms or policy implications, our results highlight the importance of raising
exporter quality-management capacities in developing countries, as periods of opendoor appear to be essentially periods of quality search.
