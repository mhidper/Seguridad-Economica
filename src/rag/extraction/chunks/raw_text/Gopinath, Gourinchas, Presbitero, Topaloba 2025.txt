Global linkages  are changing  amidst elevated  geopolitical  tensions  and a surge in policies
directed  at increasing  supply chain resilience  and national  security.  Using granular  bilateral
data, we provide  new evidence  of trade and investment  fragmentation  along geopolitical  lines
and compare  it to the early years of the Cold War. Gravity  model estimates  point to significant
declines  in trade, FDI, and portfolio  flows between  countries  in geopolitically  distant blocs since
the onset of the war in Ukraine,  relative  to flows between  countries  in the same bloc. While the
extent of fragmentation  is still relatively  small, the decoupling  between  the rival geopolitical
blocs during the Cold War suggests  it could worsen  considerably  should geopolitical  tensions
persist and trade restrictive  policies  intensify.  Different  from the early years of the Cold War, a
set of nonaligned  ‘connector’  countries  are rapidly  gaining  importance  and serving  as a bridge
between  blocs.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade,  the future of global economic  integration  has been increasingly  challenged.  Disillusionment  with the
uneven  benefits  of trade, fragility  of highly  specialized  global supply  chains  exposed  by the COVID-19  pandemic,  and geopolitical
frictions  heightened  by the war in Ukraine  are all contributing  to rethinking  commitments  to free trade. New technologies  have
also triggered  a global race to dominate  emerging  strategic  sectors,  like artificial  intelligence  (AI), renewable  energy,  and biotech.
In 2015, the Chinese  government  announced  the ‘Made in China 2025’ initiative,  with the goal of upgrading  its manufacturing
industry,  reducing  its reliance  on foreign  technology,  and raising  the domestic  content  of core components  and materials.  In 2018,
the U.S. raised tariffs on a wide range of imports  from China.  Worldwide,  policy measures,  which directly  or indirectly  restrict  trade
flows, have surged.1Yet, despite  these changes  in the policy environment  and public  sentiment,  there are no significant  changes
in the extent of globalization,  crudely  defined  as the ratio of global trade to GDP. Since the global financial  crisis, when the 2000s

Notes: Panel A plots global goods trade as a share of global GDP, and goods trade between  blocs of countries  as a share of global trade. For the Cold War,
a Western  and Eastern blocs are defined following Gokmen (2017 ). Panel B plots the average  trade growth during 2022Q2–2024Q1  minus the average  trade
growth during 2017Q1–2022Q1  within and between  blocs. For the current period, bloc definition  is based on a hypothetical  Western  bloc centered  around the
U.S. and Europe and a hypothetical  Eastern bloc centered  around China and Russia. Sections 2and3provide further details. Bilateral  quarterly  growth rates
are computed  as the difference  in log bilateral  trade, which are then aggregated  using bilateral  nominal  trade as weights.

hyperglobalization  came to an end, the ratio of goods trade to GDP has fluctuated  between  41 and 48 percent  (Fig. 1, Panel A).
Foreign  direct investment  (FDI) has become  more subdued:  global FDI as a share of GDP declined  from around  3.4 before  the global
financial  crisis to 2.5 percent  thereafter.2
A number  of studies  have argued  that underneath  the relatively  stable aggregate  trends,  a redirection  of trade and investment
flows across countries  is taking  place, potentially  signaling  fragmentation  (Aiyar et al.,2023a ;Alfaro and Chor,2023 ;Freund  et al.,
2024 ;WTO ,2023 ). ‘‘Geoeconomic  fragmentation,’’  referring  to policy-induced  changes  in the sources  and destinations  of cross-
border  flows, often guided  by strategic  considerations,  such as national  and economic  security,  may or may not be associated  with
a decline  in world trade relative  to GDP. This term, along with ‘‘reshoring,’’  ‘‘nearshoring’’  and ‘‘friend-shoring,’’  is increasingly
mentioned  in companies’  earnings  calls (Figure  S1.1, Panel B). And there is by now robust  evidence  that the trade tensions  between
the U.S. and China since 2018 have triggered  a reallocation  of the supply  chains  that have intertwined  the world’s  two largest
economies  over the past decades.3Alfaro and Chor (2023 ) andFreund  et al.(2024 ) demonstrate  that US imports  of tariffed  products
from China have decreased,  with low-wage  countries  linked  to China’s  supply  chains  and with similar  export  baskets  gaining  share in
US markets  (see alsoDang et al.,2023 ;Utar et al.,2023 ). However,  there is little evidence  whether  the looming  ‘‘great  reallocation’’
extends  beyond  US efforts  to de-risk,  friendshore  and onshore,  whether  there is broader  fragmentation  of trade and investment  along
geopolitical  lines, and what its output  and welfare  costs might be.
In the absence  of a clear theoretical  or empirical  link between  rising geopolitical  tensions  and global trade patterns,  we use the
change  in the share of trade between  politically  distant  groups  of countries  as a proxy for the extent of geoeconomic  fragmentation.4
In this choice,  we are guided  by the patterns  in global trade observed  during  the Cold War. The share of trade between  the Western-
centered  and USSR-centered  blocs declined  sharply  during  World War II (Fig. 1, Panel A).5During  the Cold War, trade between  blocs

policies.

frictions  andBown (2021 ) for a detailed  account  of its timeline.
4There is a sizable literature  examining  the effects of war and sanctions  on trade and investment  between  countries  engaged  in conflict or their neighbors  (see
Glick and Taylor ,2010 ;Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig ,2008 , among others). However,  how global trade patterns  are affected  by a rise in geopolitical  tension is
distinct,  and has only recently  been tackled by the theoretical  literature  (Broner et al.,2024 ;Clayton et al.,2024 ).
5While it is hard to precisely  date the beginning  of the Cold War, we follow the literature  and use the announcement  of theTruman Doctrine in Congress  in
March 1947 — which established  that the U.S. would provide political,  military  and economic  assistance  to all democratic  nations under authoritarian  threats
— as its start. Leffler (1984 ), among others, discusses  geopolitical  developments  at the onset of the Cold War.Journal  of International  Economics  153 (2025)  104042

continued to decline and stayed significantly below trade within blocs until 1990 even though the ratio of global goods trade to
GDP increased significantly. Against the backdrop of over a century of data, fragmentation is difficult to detect yet in the aggregate
data. Yet, while geopolitical factors have started playing a growing role in driving trade and investment flows since the U.S.-China
trade tensions, zooming in on the period after the onset of the war in Ukraine reveals clear signs of fragmentation. While trade
growth has slowed everywhere since the war in Ukraine, growth between more politically distant blocs slowed more (Fig. 1, Panel
B). Announced FDI projects within a bloc of countries have also become more common, while investments across blocs have fallen
sharply.
In this paper, we take these emerging prima facie signs of fragmentation as a starting point and uncover a set of novel stylized
facts, which, taken together, provide support for the argument that trade, investment, and capital flows may be fragmenting along
geopolitical lines. Our focus is the reorientation of trade, financial and capital flows between geopolitical blocs, which may or may
not be accompanied by changes in global/aggregate flows. We contrast our findings with the Cold War experience — a notable
historical example of geopolitical fragmentation — to put our results in context, speculate about the course of fragmentation should
geopolitical tensions and trade policy restrictions continue intensifying, and highlight the role that nonaligned economies could play
today — differently from the Cold War — in shaping fragmentation’s macroeconomic effects.
First, we find significant reshuffling in countries’ sourcing of imports and FDI. Reallocation across import and FDI sources has
surged, especially after the onset of the war in Ukraine, reaching levels not seen over the past two decades.
Second, we reveal the cracks that are emerging in cross-border flows by estimating gravity models of trade, investment, and
portfolio flows. After accounting for all country-level shocks and time-invariant factors that may shape the extent of trade and
investment between country pairs, we document that trade flows and the number of announced FDI projects between a U.S.-centered
and a China-centered bloc are, respectively, 11 and 12 percent lower than trade and investment between countries within the same
bloc since the war in Ukraine. Consistent with these results, the shares of portfolio holdings between blocs also declined by 0.5
percentage point more than those within blocs after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The shortfall in cross-border flows is both
economically and statistically significant, though still a fraction of the trade shortfall between rival blocs during the Cold War.
Importantly, the shortfall is not limited to flows between the U.S. and China. The comparison with the Cold War also highlights a
different role for nonaligned countries. While during the Cold War, trade with nonaligned economies declined by around 40 percent
(although not to the same extent as trade between opposing blocs), currently we do not observe any relative reduction in trade and
investment flows involving nonaligned countries.
Third, zooming in on trade between the U.S. and China, we confirm the adverse effects of the US tariffs on Chinese imports,
and the precipitous decline of China as a source for US imports. Recent data also confirm the emergence of ‘connector’ countries,
as exports from a set of nonaligned economies are substituting for declining Chinese imports by the U.S., and those economies tend
to have increased their imports from China. Moreover, combining trade and announced FDI projects data, we establish a strong
positive correlation between countries’ gain in US import market share and their gain in Chinese outward FDI. While establishing
the direction of causality is beyond the scope of this paper, this finding adds to the growing anecdotal evidence of Chinese firms
investing in countries, through which they can access US markets (Bloomberg ,2023 ;Lopez and Vázquez ,2023 ). This finding is in
sharp contrast to the experience during the Cold War. Our analysis suggests that the nonaligned economies at the time did not step
in to bridge the gap between the Eastern and Western blocs, perhaps reflecting their much lower degree of integration in the global
marketplace, higher trade barriers and transport costs, and the different nature of traded goods. On the other hand, there is large
uncertainty about the extent to which the currently nonaligned economies will continue to serve as bridges between geopolitical
blocs and maintain ties with both sides should geopolitical tensions and rivalry intensify.
In sum, we find that fragmentation in trade and investment flows is becoming reality. It is hard to speculate whether it will
deepen and how longlasting it will be given its recent onset: its evolution will depend on whether geopolitical tensions persist and
trade restricting policies continue to mount. But our findings also reveal a conundrum: the more cross-border flows are rerouted via
‘connector’ countries, the less effective the policies driving fragmentation may be in achieving their stated objectives. Policymakers
have motivated measures that restrict trade either directly or indirectly on the grounds of strengthening the resilience of supply
chains, de-risking and increasing economic and national security (Bernstein ,2023 ;Sullivan ,2023 ;Yellen ,2022 ). However, the
reshuffling that is taking place seems to be lengthening supply chains (Qiu et al.,2023 ), as connector countries are stepping in to
bridge the gap between rival blocs. This could potentially bring new fragilities, in addition to raising inefficiencies. Moreover, even
if direct links to less politically aligned partners are severed, exposure may not change substantively if imports and FDI from China
underpin the exports by more politically aligned trading partners.
Related literature. This study relates to several fast growing strands of literature. First, we contribute to recent studies on the impact
of geopolitics on global real and financial activity. Clayton et al.(2023 ) introduce a theoretical framework for the interplay between
geopolitics and economic competition. Broner et al.(2024 ) show that, as shifts in power relationships drive international trade, the
emergence of a multipolar world could unravel globalization and create winners and losers. Aiyar et al.(2023b ) provide an overview
of recent empirical and modeling work on fragmentation, global trade, investment and financial flows. Geopolitical distance between
country pairs tends to be associated with lower bilateral trade, FDI and financial flows, especially since the U.S.-China trade tensions
in 2018-2019 (Aiyar et al.,2024 ;Aiyar and Ohnsorge ,2024 ;Catalán et al.,2024 ). While this evidence predates the Russian invasion
of Ukraine, a related analysis developed contemporaneously with ours byBlanga-Gubbay and Rubínová (2023 ) and subsequent work
byQiu et al.(2024 ) find that trade has become more sensitive to geopolitical distance since the start of the war in Ukraine. To the
best of our knowledge, our study is one of the first to present comprehensive and recent evidence of emerging geopolitical fault
lines globally in trade, investment, and portfolio flows in a common framework, focusing on flows between and within blocs and
with nonaligned countries.Journal  of International  Economics  153 (2025)  104042

Second, we build on studies that examine the realignment of US import sourcing from China towards other countries using
product-level (Alfaro and Chor,2023 ;Benguria and Saffie ,2024 ;Fajgelbaum et al.,2024 ;Freund et al.,2024 ;Goldberg and Reed,
2023 ) and firm-level data (Alfaro et al.,2024 ;Handley et al.,2024 ;Utar et al.,2023 ). We expand this literature in two ways. First, we
seek broader evidence of fragmentation and supply chain shifts given the surge in trade restrictive measures and elevated geopolitical
tensions globally, drawing insights from the Cold War era. Second, we examine both trade, investment and portfolio flows in a
comparable manner, contrary to previous studies that have mostly focused on trade (e.g. Freund et al.,2024 ;Blanga-Gubbay and
Rubínová ,2023 ). We also find robust evidence for both bilateral total and product-level trade of the emergence of ‘connector’
countries. The finding that fragmentation is occurring in both goods and capital flows in an interrelated manner is novel and brings
quantitative substance to mounting anecdotal evidence of FDI used to circumvent trade restrictions, and the broader literature on
horizontal versus vertical FDI (Helpman ,1984 ;Helpman et al.,2004 ;Antràs and Yeaple ,2014 ;Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare ,
2013 ;Tintelnot ,2017 ). Relatedly, Xue(2023 ) presents complementary evidence on the connection between US tariffs on Chinese
imports, trade and FDI, and develops a general equilibrium model incorporating trade and FDI diversion.
Third, our study also relates to the recent literature on the economic costs of geoeconomic fragmentation (see, among others,
Javorcik et al.,2024 ;Aiyar et al.,2023b ;Campos et al.,2023 ;Hakobyan et al.,2023 ;Panon et al.,2024 ). This literature simulates
the impact of fragmentation assuming a sharp increase in trade/FDI/technology diffusion costs between blocs of countries. Our
study provides estimates of the relative increase in trade/FDI costs between and within blocs, which could guide future modeling
work towards more realistic fragmentation scenarios.6
Finally, our study adds to the literature on the Cold War (see, for example, Schiller ,1955 ;Gokmen ,2017 ;Morrow, Siverson,
and Tabares ,1998 ). In a related paper, Campos et al.(2024 ) show that the Cold War had an effect similar to a 48% ad valorem
tariff and roughly halved East–West trade flows. We contribute to this literature by examining the role of nonaligned economies.
We are also the first to compare the incipient signs of fragmentation to the experience during the early years of the Cold War.
2. Data
The analysis relies on annual and monthly data on bilateral trade flows from the Trade Data Monitor (TDM), a private data
provider. TDM sources trade data at the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HS) level from government offices and agencies of over 115
countries, accounting for more than 95 percent of world GDP. A key advantage of TDM over the UN COMTRADE database is its
timeliness. The Historical Bilateral Trade and Gravity dataset (TRADHIST) byFouquin and Hugot (2016 ) allows us to examine
bilateral trade during the Cold War.
FDI data are from fDi Markets , a service from the Financial Times, which tracks over 330,000 announcements of new and
expansions of existing projects between January 2003 and June 2024 between 186 countries. As the value of capital investment
is often estimated, our analysis is mostly based on the number of FDI projects. However, we establish the robustness of our main
results to the use of FDI values—see Annex S3 for a discussion of the fDi Markets data and their reliability.
Data on portfolio flows are from the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), which collects bilateral data on
countries’ holdings of cross-border portfolio investment (equity or debt) securities, excluding cross-border direct investment or
reserve assets. The sample covers 84 reporting countries (and 195 counterparts) and with data on portfolio positions at a semi-annual
basis from 2015 to the end of 2023.
Bilateral geopolitical distance, which we use to assign countries to hypothetical blocs, is based on voting patterns at the United
Nations General Assembly (UNGA). We use theideal point distance (IPD), estimated with ‘‘constant’’ UNGA agenda, and provided
byBailey et al.(2017 ).7
3. Findings
3.1. Reallocation
To gauge reallocation across trading and FDI partners, we compute a commonly used measure of structural change — the
Lilien (1982 ) Index — using annual bilateral import data and inward FDI for each country since 2000. Underneath the broadly stable
aggregate trends of trade and FDI, there was a sharp uptick in the extent of reallocation across import and FDI sources, especially after
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (Fig. 2). The increase in the trade Lilien index is especially pronounced among advanced economies
(Table S2.1, panel A). For emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) where the extent of reallocation is structurally
higher, the increase is not as noticeable. Compared to the average observed over 2003–2021, import reallocation has increased by
roughly 15 percent after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the full sample, and by almost 40 percent in advanced economies. FDI
exhibits striking similarity, with reallocation increasing significantly more for advanced economies (Table S2.1, panel B).
6Fernandez-Villaverde et al.(2024 ) compute a measure of geopolitical fragmentation based on a broad set of country-level indicators and estimate its GDP
and sectoral output effects. Their measure captures both potential onshoring and deglobalization contrary to the bilateral trade and FDI costs our analysis
infers. Bonadio et al.(2024 ) rely on a data-driven approach to measure trade fragmentation, based on changes in trade costs with the U.S. and China over the
period 2015–23, and use a quantitative trade model to compute the real income effect of the reconfiguration of the global trade costs.

(MLI) on country and year fixed effects with 2017 the excluded  year. The Modified  Lilien Index (MLI), often used to measure  sectoral  shifts in output, is based
on the standard  deviation  of the sectoral  growth rates from time period𝑡− 1to𝑡:

𝑟, and𝑆𝑖𝑟𝑡=𝑥𝑖𝑟𝑡∕𝑋𝑟𝑡is the average  share of imports (FDI) from partner𝑖in total imports (FDI) of country𝑟. The index equals 0 if there is no structural  change
between𝑡− 1and𝑡. The higher the value of the index, the greater is the structural  change; in other words, the bigger the reallocation  of imports (FDI) across
partners.

3.2. Fragmentation
Uncovering  the patterns  underneath  the increase  in reallocation  of import  and FDI sources  will occupy  researchers  for years to
come as new data on global supply  chains,  world input–output  matrices,  and bilateral  flows become  available.  We take a first stab at
examining  whether  the re-configuration  of trade and investment  could be related  to geopolitical  considerations.  We remain  agnostic
about the causal  effects  of recently  announced  policy intentions  and measures  aimed at ‘‘de-risking’’,  creating/maintaining  strategic
advantage,  and ensuring  national  or economic  security  through  ‘‘onshoring’’,  ‘‘nearshoring’’  or ‘‘friend-shoring.’’  The purpose  of
this exercise  is to use a common  approach  to establish  whether  there are signs of fragmentation  of trade, FDI, and portfolio  flows
between  groups  of countries  that are potentially  more geopolitically  distant.
We define groups  of geopolitically  aligned  countries  following  recent studies,  which use the similarity  of countries’  voting  patterns
at the UNGA  to capture  countries’  bilateral  political  attitudes  towards  one another  (Aiyar et al.,2024 ). Countries  are divided  into
three groups  based on the 2021 Ideal Point Distance:  a U.S. leaning  bloc, which includes  countries  in the top quartile  in their political
proximity  to the U.S., a China leaning  bloc, which includes  countries  in the top quartile  in their political  proximity  to China,  and
a set of nonaligned  countries,  comprising  the remaining  economies.  We also consider  an alternative,  narrower  definition  of blocs,
allowing  a larger group of nonaligned  economies.8
To gauge fragmentation,  we estimate  standard  gravity  models,  the conventional  framework  for assessing  the determinants  of
trade, investment,  and portfolio  flows, which can be derived  from many theoretical  models:
𝑌𝑠𝑑 𝑡=𝛽1𝐵 𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛  𝐵 𝑙 𝑜𝑐𝑠𝑑×𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡+𝛽2𝑁 𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑔 𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑑×𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡+𝛿𝑠𝑑+𝜏𝑠𝑡+𝜙𝑑 𝑡+𝜖𝑠𝑑 𝑡, (1)
where the dependent  variable  is either:  (i) the value of trade between  country𝑠and country𝑑(in USD); (ii) the number  or the value
of announced  FDI projects  from source  country𝑠to destination  country𝑑in period𝑡; and (iii) the change  in the share of portfolio
assets held by the reporting  country𝑠in the counterpart  country𝑑between𝑡and𝑡− 1. To measure  whether  flows between  blocs
have changed  differentially  over time, we include  two dummies—a  dummy  for country  pairs in which the two countries  belong  to
different  blocs,𝐵 𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛  𝐵 𝑙 𝑜𝑐𝑠𝑑, and a dummy  for country  pairs in which at least one country  is nonaligned, 𝑁 𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑔 𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑑, leaving
country  pairs in which the two countries  are assigned  to the same geopolitical  bloc as the omitted  category.  We interact  both of these
dummies  with an indicator  equal to 1 after Russia’s  invasion  of Ukraine  (from 2022:q1  onward),𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡.9The coefficients  on these
interacted  dummies,  e.g.𝛽1, capture  whether  trade/FDI/portfolio  holdings  between  countries  in the two politically  distant  blocs in
the post-war  period  differs  from trade/FDI/portfolio  holdings  between  countries  in the same geopolitical  bloc (the omitted  category).
The fully-saturated  specification,  with country-pair  (𝛿𝑠𝑑), source ×year (𝜏𝑠𝑡) and destination ×year (𝜙𝑑 𝑡) fixed effects,  accounts  for
all time-invariant  country-pair  determinants  of trade and investment  flows between  countries  (such as geographical  and political
8In this case, a hypothetical  Western  bloc includes  the U.S., Europe, Canada,  Australia  and New Zealand,  and a hypothetical  Eastern bloc comprises  Belarus,
China, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua,  Russia, and Syria, with the other countries  considered  nonaligned.
9We define the𝑃 𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡period to start at the onset of the war in Ukraine  given the significant  increase  in reallocation  across import and FDI sources described
in Section 3.1in 2022–23  and the evidence  presented  in Figure S1.2.Journal  of International  Economics  153 (2025)  104042

distance, contiguity, common language, common colonial past, and the like), and the effect of all source- and destination-specific
time-varying factors and shocks, such as GDP growth, change in country risk, implemented and announced policies affecting all
partners, and countries’ multilateral resistance terms.
We estimate the gravity model using Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML), using quarterly data over 2017:q1-2024:q1
for trade and 2008:q1-2024:q2 for FDI.10For portfolio holdings, as the dependent variable is the change in the portfolio share,
we estimate the gravity model with OLS using semiannual data over 2015:s1-2023:s2. Robust standard errors are clustered at the
country-pair level to account for potential correlation in flows over time at the bilateral level.
Table 1reports the coefficients of interest,𝛽1and𝛽2, estimated using alternative sets of fixed effects and bloc definitions. Across
all specifications, there is strong evidence that trade, FDI, and portfolio holdings between blocs have declined relative to trade, FDI,
and portfolio holdings within blocs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (columns 1–6). Focusing on the fully saturated PPML estimates
using the wider bloc definition (panel A, columns 2 and 4), after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, trade and FDI between blocs
declined by roughly 11 and 12 percent more than flows within blocs, respectively.11The shares of portfolio holdings between blocs
declined by 0.5 percentage point more than those within blocs, which is a relatively large variation given that the average portfolio
share in the sample (conditional on the share being positive) is 1.5 percent. These patterns are not driven uniquely by the U.S. or
China. Results are broadly robust to excluding these countries from the sample, although the decline in FDI between blocs and the
resilience of those with nonaligned countries seems to be driven by Chinese and US flows, respectively (Table S2.2). The FDI results
are also robust to using the value of the investments (in USD) instead of the count measure (Table S2.3). Overall, these findings are
consistent with recent evidence showing geopolitical alignment to be an increasingly important driver of trade (Qiu et al.,2024 ),
FDI (Aiyar et al.,2024 ), and cross-border portfolio flows (Catalán et al.,2024 ). However, our findings further demonstrate that,
since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, geopolitical alignments are associated with non-trivial fractures in the global system of trade,
FDI and portfolio flows.
To examine the exact timing of trade fragmentation, we estimate Eq.1with a full set of time dummies, interacted with the
𝐵 𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝐵 𝑙 𝑜𝑐𝑠𝑑and𝑁 𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑔 𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑠𝑑country-pair indicators, and plot the PPML coefficients along with the 90th percentile confidence
interval in Figure S1.2. The divergence in trade between blocs compared to trade within blocs clearly began after Russia’s invasion
in Ukraine (Panel A). In particular, the war acted as a ‘developing agent’ for geoeconomic fragmentation: trade between blocs started
falling partly because of the collapse of Russia’s trade with the euro area and (to a lesser extent) with the U.S., while trade within
bloc increased as the share of Russia’s trade with China more than doubled since the invasion (Figure S1.3).
To gauge the magnitude of fragmentation along geopolitical lines, we compare the current trade fragmentation with the Cold War
period—arguably the most prominent example of fragmentation in recent history. Using bilateral annual trade data from 1920–1990
and a bloc definition centered on a West–East divide as inGokmen (2017 ) andHuntington (1998 ), we estimate Eq.1focusing on the
interaction between the𝐵 𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝐵 𝑙 𝑜𝑐𝑠𝑑dummy and an indicator that takes on the value of 1 for the Cold War period (1947–1990).
Columns 7–8 ofTable 1reveal that trade between the rival Western and Eastern blocs declined by two thirds during the Cold War,
relative to trade within these blocs.12
Fig. 3directly compares the fall in trade between blocs in the current period and during the Cold War. The findings are naturally
sensitive to the choice of the onset date—in the figure, we use 2022:q1 and 1947 as the beginning of fragmentation during the current
period and the Cold War, respectively. The chart suggests that the fragmentation observed thus far is not significantly different from
the experience in the initial years of the Cold War. However, compared to the average ‘‘between-bloc trade shortfall’’ during the
Cold War (Table 1, columns 1–2 and 7–8, panel A), fragmentation so far is an order of magnitude smaller.
This should not foster complacency as trade fragmentation could worsen over time if geopolitical tensions persist and restrictive
trade policies continue to mount. During the Cold War, trade between blocs did not collapse overnight. It took at least five years for
trade between blocs to significantly decline compared to flows within blocs, and over a decade to reach a nadir relative to within-bloc
trade (Fig. 3and S1.2). Moreover, the size of the ‘‘treatment’’ today vs the Cold War is very different. While the ideological and
economic rivalry between the U.S. and China is reminiscent of the one between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the second half of the
20th century and policymakers are emphatic about the need to ‘‘de-risk’’ and ‘‘friendshore,’’ (Bernstein ,2023 ;Sullivan ,2023 ;Yellen ,
2022 ), we are (and will hopefully remain) very far from the ‘‘Iron Curtain’’ that descended across Europe in 1946 (Churchill ,1946 ).
US trade policy towards communist countries intensified over time and consisted of a combination of (i) high tariffs, which were
brought back to the pre-GATT 1930 level (excluding for some raw materials), (ii) export controls, especially directed at military and
strategic products, and (iii) specific sanctions, including total embargo to North Korea and China (Cooper ,2010 ). Viewed through
that lens, the geopolitical cracks that are emerging in trade and investment data — while still shallow — are a source of concern.
On the other hand, the stage on which fragmentation is taking place is fundamentally different (Gopinath ,2024 ). The economic
interdependence between countries is much higher today as effective trade costs have declined substantially, both due to reductions
in policy trade barriers, such as gradually dismantled tariffs, and improvements in shipping, information and communication
technology. As a result, trade, including in services, has become a much bigger part of economic activity and production is shared
10Our analysis does not consider domestic trade flows, which are important to estimate the intensive and extensive margins of trade (Yotov ,2022 ), due
to data constraints. We also focus on fragmentation as reorientation of trade flows across trading partners; onshoring production without discriminating across
trading partners is not captured in the analysis.
11Given the functional form, the decline in trade between blocs relative to trade within blocs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can be computed as(𝑒𝛽− 1) × 100.
Using the PPML results in columns 2 and 4:(𝑒−0.1212− 1) × 100 = −11.4%for trade and (𝑒−0.1309− 1) × 100 = −12.3%for FDI.
12Using the PPML results in column 8:(𝑒−1.11− 1) × 100 = −67% . This effect is somewhat larger but in the same order of magnitude of the estimates byCampos
et al.(2024 ) using a quantitative trade model.Journal  of International  Economics  153 (2025)  104042

Notes: The table reports the results of a gravity model using Poisson pseudo-maximum  likelihood  (PPML, columns 1–4, 7–8) and ordinary least squares (OLS, columns 5-6), where the dependent
variable is: the bilateral trade in US dollars (columns 1–2 and 7–8); the number of announced  FDI projects (columns 3–4); and the change in the share of portfolio assets (columns 5–6). Data are
quarterly in columns 1–4, semiannual  in columns 5–6, and annual in columns 7-8. The sample spans 2017:q1-2024:q1  (columns 1–2), 2008:q1-2024:q2  (columns 3-4), 2015:s1-2023:s2  (columns 5-6)
and 1920–1990  (excluding  World War II, 1939–1945,  columns 7–8). The FDI analysis excludes country pairs with less than 5 investment  projects over the sample period. The Post War variable
identifies the period following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is equal to 1 from 2022:q1 onwards. The Cold War dummy is equal to 1 for the years 1947–1990.  The Between Bloc variable
equals 1 if the source and destination  country do not belong to the same geopolitical  bloc, and 0 otherwise.  The Nonaligned  variable equals 1 if at least one country in the pair is nonaligned.
In the current period, blocs are centered around the U.S. and China, with a group of countries remaining  nonaligned.  The wider bloc definition (panel A) uses the Ideal Point Distance (a measure
based on UNGA voting patterns computed byBailey et al.(2017 )) to assign countries into blocs. The narrower bloc definition (panel B) is based on a hypothetical  Western bloc including the
U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and a hypothetical  Eastern bloc comprising  Belarus, China, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua,  Russia, and Syria, with the rest considered  nonaligned.  For
the Cold War period, we use the bloc definition based onGokmen (2017 ). The Western bloc includes Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Luxembourg,  Malta, Monaco, Netherlands,  New Zealand, Norway, Philippines,  Portugal, San Marino, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Türkiye, United Kingdom, United States. The Eastern
bloc includes Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan,  Belarus, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Lao People’s Dem. Rep., Latvia, Lithuania,  Moldova,
Mongolia,  North Korea, Poland, Romania, Russia (USSR), Slovakia, Turkmenistan,  Ukraine, Uzbekistan,  Vietnam. The remaining  countries are considered  nonaligned.  Standard errors in parenthesis  are

Notes: The charts plot the change in global trade between  blocs (Panel A) and with nonaligned  countries  (Panel B) during the Cold War (blue line, with𝑡0= 1947)
and since the Russian invasion  of Ukraine  (red line, with𝑡0=2021:Q4).  For each episode,  the charts plot the semi-elasticity  of trade for flows (between  blocs in
panel A and with nonaligned  countries  in panel B), and the associated  90 percent confidence  bands, estimated  with PPML and a fully saturated  gravity model
as in equation 1in the main text. The missing category  is trade within blocs. The Cold War results are obtained  using annual data 1920-1990  — excluding  the
World War II years (1939-1945),  and with 1947 as excluded  year — and the bloc definition  based onGokmen (2017 ). The results for the most recent period
are based on quarterly  trade data 2017:Q1-2024:Q1  (with 2021:Q4  as excluded  quarter),  with the wider bloc definition  based on the Ideal Point Distance  (a

through  complex  global value chains.  In the beginning  of the Cold War (1947–1952),  global goods trade was only 12 percent  of
GDP, while in 2019–2023,  the global goods trade-to-GDP  ratio averaged  roughly  44 percent.  Including  services,  trade exceeded  60
percent  of global GDP in 2022. Moreover,  while trade in primary  goods accounted  for more than 40 percent  of total trade duringJournal  of International  Economics  153 (2025)  104042

1947–1952, it was only 14 percent of cross-country goods flows during 2019–2023, reflecting the rise in trade in intermediates and
final goods. In other words, despite the extreme levels of fragmentation of trade between blocs during the Cold War, trade within
blocs flourished reflecting policies and technological advances that effectively reduced trade costs between countries in the same
geopolitical bloc.
3.3. Connectors
The role of nonaligned countries may also be fundamentally different today compared to the Cold War. The gravity equations
already suggest interesting differences. As can be seen inTable 1, columns 7 and 8, during the Cold War, trade with nonaligned
economies also remained significantly lower (−37 percent) than trade within blocs. In the current period, trade with nonaligned
economies has kept up with within-bloc trade (Table 1, columns 1 and 2 andFig. 3, panel B). There is, however, large uncertainty
about the extent to which the currently nonaligned economies will continue to keep with trade within blocs. When zooming in on
the most recent quarters (Figure S1.2), one can detect a small but statistically significant decline even in trade with nonaligned
countries relative to trade between blocs, which may reflect the rising uncertainty regarding the connector role played by the
unaligned economies as geopolitical tensions intensify.
The role of nonaligned economies in the U.S.-China trade tensions has been subject to a number of studies. The surge in trade
frictions between the U.S. and China and the restrictions imposed since 2018 have significantly hit trade between the two countries.
China is no longer the largest trading partner to the U.S.: according to the US Census Bureau data, its share of US goods imports has
fallen by roughly 8 percentage points in 6 years: from 22 percent in 2017 to 14 percent in 2023. China is also no longer a prominent
destination for outward US FDI, losing rank to emerging markets such as India, Mexico, and UAE in the number of announced FDI
projects.
But there is mounting evidence that direct links between the U.S. and China are simply being replaced by indirect links. As
China lost market shares in US imports, other countries, specifically Mexico, Canada, a number of Asian economies, most notably
Vietnam, have gained prominence (Dahlman and Lovely ,2023 ). Countries that have gained the most in US import shares — such
as Mexico and Vietnam — have also gained more in China’s export shares (Alfaro and Chor,2023 ;Dang et al.,2023 ;Freund et al.,
2024 ;Utar et al.,2023 ;Kahn et al.,2024 ). The same countries are also larger recipients of Chinese FDI. While most of this evidence
is anecdotal or based on specific case studies, Fig. 4shows that there is a robust and economically sizable association between the
increase of Chinese presence in a country — measured either through exports (panel A) or the number of announced greenfield
investment (panel C) — and the increase in trade outward linkages of that country with the U.S. The results shown in panel A
suggest that a 1 percent increase in the US import share between 2013–17 and 2018–23 is associated with a 1.6 percent higher
share of Chinese exports over the same period. When looking at FDI the same 1 percent share in import shares is associated with a
0.7 percent increase in the share of FDI from China.13
The strong correlation between the rise in imports from China and a rise in exports to the U.S. also holds at various level of
disaggregation of products (Figure S1.6 and Table S2.4, panel A) with the correlation declining the more finely the products are
defined (from 2-digit to 4-digit and 6-digit HS levels). This is to be expected if trade through nonaligned countries comprises both
re-export of Chinese products and value creation using Chinese inputs. Finally, while not conclusive, two pieces of evidence suggest
that the observed patterns for unaligned countries do not simply reflect a secular process of fast growing low-cost countries gaining
share in the global market place. First, the correlation between gains in US import shares and the rise in imports from China at the
6-digit HS level is particularly strong for products whose imports from China became subject to tariffs in the U.S. in 2018 (Table
S2.4, column 7). Second, a placebo test in which we perform the same analysis prior to the escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions
reveals no such correlation (Figure S1.7 and Table S2.4, panel B).
In contrast, there is no evidence that nonaligned economies served as connectors between rival blocs during the Cold War. If
they did, we would expect to see a similar correlation between the extent to which nonaligned economies gained share in Western
markets’ imports and the extent to which they increased their imports from the Eastern bloc of countries. As shown inFig. 4, Panel
B, the two series are completely orthogonal. The severance of direct links between the Western and Eastern bloc during the Cold
War likely led to a severance of economic exposure, unlike what may be happening today.
Why did nonaligned economies not step in as connectors in the 1950s but are doing so currently, at least for now? Rigorously
disentangling the drivers of the response of nonaligned economies is beyond the scope of this paper, however, some relevant
differences stand out. To begin with, the nonaligned countries at the time of the Cold War had a much smaller economic footprint.
In 1950, the Western and Eastern blocs together accounted for roughly 85 percent of global GDP and more than half of the world’s
population. The nonaligned countries were mostly developing economies, which received foreign aid, technical assistance and
military equipment motivated by geopolitical considerations (Cooper ,2010 ). Depending on whether countries choose to associate
themselves with a particular bloc, the group of nonaligned economies today could have much greater economic heft, in terms of
market share, and population. Today’s nonaligned economies are also much more integrated into the world marketplace: for the
median nonaligned economy, the trade-to-GDP ratio was 80 percent in 2019; compared to 40 percent of GDP in 1960. The average
most favored nation import tariff of the median nonaligned country was 12 percent in 2019 vs 40 percent in 1960, and the median
nonaligned economy in 2015 had free trade agreements with partners equivalent to one fifth of global GDP, compared to 0 percent
in 1960.
13Results are robust to excluding individual countries (e.g. Japan, see Figure S1.4), and controlling for countries’ GDP growth. Those on FDI are robust to
the use of value rather than count data, see Figure S1.5.Journal  of International  Economics  153 (2025)  104042

Notes: All panels include only nonaligned  countries.  Panel A plots the change in US import shares between  2018–23  and 2013–17  against the change in Chinese
export shares over the same period. A weighted  regression  (with the US imports in the pre-period  as weights)  with robust standard  errors gives a slope equal to
1.634(p-value  =0.000); n = 57. Panel B plots the change of the Western  bloc import shares between  1952–56  and 1934–38  against the change of the Eastern
bloc export shares over the same period. A weighted  regressions  (with the Western  bloc imports in the pre-period  as weights)  with robust standard  errors gives
a slope equal to−0.026(p-value  =0.628); n = 81. Panel C plots the change in US import shares between  2018–23  and 2013–17  against the change in Chinese
outward  FDI over the same period. A weighted  regressions  (with the US imports in the pre-period  as weights)  with robust standard  errors gives a slope equal
to0.727(p-value  =0.005); n = 45. In all cases, results are robust to: (i) using the Chinese  exports (panel A) or FDI (panel B) as weights;  (ii) using the weights
computed  in the 2018–23  period; and (iii) excluding  outliers (see Figure S1.4). For panels A and C results are robust to controlling  for the average  real GDP
growth in period 2018–2023.

4. Conclusion
This paper establishes  a number  of relevant  stylized  facts about the extent to which geoeconomic  fragmentation  is reshaping
global linkages  and draws lessons  from the historical  experience  of the Cold War. We find that, like during  the Cold War, trade,
FDI, and portfolio  flows between  blocs are decreasing,  compared  to trade, investment  and portfolio  flows within  blocs. While the
decoupling  remains  small compared  to that earlier  episode,  it is also in its early stages and could worsen  significantly  if geopolitical
tensions  persist  and restrictive  trade policies  continue  to mount.
We also find that increasing  geoeconomic  fragmentation  did not give rise to deglobalization,  then or now. But the reason
is fundamentally  different.  During  the Cold War, active efforts  to foster trade integration  (within  blocs) and technological
improvements  paved the way for a surge in trade. This process  became  turbocharged  once the countries  of the former  Eastern  bloc
joined  the global economy  in 1991. Now, global trade and investment  have been resilient  mostly  because  flows have been re-routed
via connector  countries.  These nonaligned  countries  could benefit  from rising geoeconomic  fragmentation.  But this finding  highlights
a fundamental  conundrum:  the global economy  is more resilient  in part because  it is increasingly  substituting  away from tariffed
or sanctioned  trade. But this substitution  does not necessarily  increase  diversification,  resilience,  or lessen strategic  dependence.
The path forward  will hinge largely  on whether  policymakers  decide  to preserve  the gains from an integrated  global economy,
perhaps  turning  a blind eye to the re-routed  flows, or opt instead  for more severe  forms of decoupling.
