Dominance on World Markets: 
the China Conundrum
Summary
We characterize China’s atypical dominance in world trade at the product level and analyze a number of factors that 
could explain it. 
Defining product-level dominant positions as a share of more than 50% of worldwide exports, we show that China held a 
dominant position in almost 600 products out of some 5,000 in 2019. This is at least six times greater than the equivalent 
number for the United States, Japan or any other country, and twice the number for the European Union considered as a 
whole. This large number of dominant positions held by China is atypical by historical standards, at least since the 1970s. 
While we do not identify definite causes of China’s numerous dominant positions, we can rule out some explanations. 
The number of dominant positions is not explained by Chinese global market share alone. Nor is it explained by China’s 
sector specialization; dominant positions are prevalent in several important sectors (electronics, textiles/wearing 
apparel, footwear and machinery). 
Looking at pricing behavior, a fine-grained analysis based on individual firms’ average market share suggests that 
Chinese firms use their market power to charge significant mark-ups, much more than French exporters.
Such product-level dominant positions make it difficult for importers to substitute their supplier for another, at least in 
the short term. This may be consequential in an open world increasingly seen through the lens of dependencies.

Dominance on World Markets: the China Conundrum     Introduction
In 2019, China held a dominant position in the global economy, 
defined by a share of more than 50% of the worldwide export 
market, for almost 600  products at the most detailed level of 
harmonized trade classifications (around 5,000  products). 
This means that China supplies at least half of global imports 
for these products. This figure is at least six times greater 
than the equivalent number for the United States, Japan or 
any other country; even the European Union considered as a 
whole does not reach half this level. 
This fact is intriguing, and is potentially consequential. 
Indeed, close economic interdependence, and trade relations 
in particular, are increasingly considered through the lens 
of dependence, thus raising questions of vulnerability and 
leverage. A dominant position, 
as we define it, is significant 
because it implies that buyers of 
a good on international markets 
will find it difficult to replace their 
supplier with another. Relying on 
a 50% threshold to characterize 
dominance is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, and we will 
check our results’ robustness to using alternative values. 
However, arithmetically, having a more-than-half share 
of a market implies that the country is the most important 
provider, generally by far. Hence, a supplier that enjoys a 
dominant position has more leverage over its buyers, and 
puts competitors at a disadvantage. At the same time, a buyer 
that relies on imports of a product where one of the exporters 
holds a dominant position is vulnerable to disruptions from a 
dominant source. 
Recent empirical assessments of trade vulnerabilities reflect 
this view. For example, the European Commission  (2021) 
defines dependencies as “reliance on a limited number of 
actors for the supply of goods, services, data, infrastructures, 
skills and technologies combined with a limited capacity 
for internal production to substitute imports”. Accordingly, 
building on previous work by Bonneau and Nakaa (2020), 
the first step in the empirical identification of dependencies 
relies on an indicator of the concentration of EU imports 
from extra-EU sources. Jaravel and Méjean (2021) focus 
on products for which more than half of French imports are 
sourced from extra-EU countries, and for which imports are 
strongly concentrated (Herfindahl-Hirschman index of imports 
by origin larger than 0.5). Zenglein (2020), in assessing the 
EU’s situation with regard to China, defines dependencies as 
products where the EU is a net importer, with more than 50% 
of its imports coming from China, and China supplying more 
than 30% of global exports. Beyond their differences, these 
assessments of trade vulnerabilities thus all focus on the 
concentration of imports.  
The very large number of products for which China 
enjoys a dominant position at the world level is far more than a statistical curiosity; it has potentially meaningful 
consequences from a political economy point of view. This is 
why this Policy Brief aims at analyzing in depth this pattern: Is 
it only a matter of sheer size, given that China is the leading 
world exporter of merchandise? Is it a recent pattern? Is it 
unusual by historical standards?  
    1. China’s dominant positions:  
more than size can explain
China is the largest exporter of goods worldwide. Therefore, it 
is natural that it is also the country holding the largest number 
of product-level dominant positions, defined as a world-
level export market share above 50%.1 Indeed, the number 
of product-level dominant positions is closely related to a 
country’s aggregate share in world export (Figure  1), and 
the relationship is even stronger for large exporters (Panel 
A) than for other countries (Panel  B). However, even taking 
its high market share into account, the number of product-
level dominant positions appears particularly high for China. 
With an export market share slightly larger than the EU’s 
(18% vs. 17%), it holds twice as many dominant positions; 
the US’s market share is much smaller, at 11%, but it has 
approximately six times fewer dominant positions.
This is even more surprising given China’s intermediate income 
level. According to Imbs and Wacziarg (2003, p.  3), “various 
measures of sectoral concentration follow a U-shaped pattern 
across a wide variety of data 
sources: countries first diversify, 
in the sense that economic activity is 
spread more equally across sectors, 
but there exists, relatively late in the 
development process, a point at 
which they start specializing again”. 
This pattern is also manifested in a 
U-shape pattern in exports shares 
(Cadot, Carrère & Strauss-Kahn, 
2011). China’s intermediate level of 
income would suggest that it should 
be well diversified in its export 
products, without exhibiting particularly strong specializations. 
In contrast, China’s relatively large number of dominant 
positions reflects a concentration of exports on products in 
which it is dominant.2 
(1) We use the CEPII-BACI database (Gaulier and Zignago, 2010), which 
provides bilateral trade flows in value for over 200 countries at the product 
level. Products are defined at the 6 digit level of the Harmonized System, 
which distinguishes over 5,000 different products. We use the HS-1992 
version of BACI to have consistent data over 1997–2019. We consider the 
EU27 (without the UK) as a single country, and disregard intra-EU27 trade 
in all calculations.
(2) The relationship is not arithmetically provable here, for two reasons: the 
count focuses on the threshold of 50%, and products are not equally important 
in world trade. in 2019, China held a 
dominant position for 
almost 600 products
for a similar market 
share in world 
exports, China 
invariably holds a 
substantially larger 
number of product-
level dominant 
positions
CEPII  – Policy Brief  No 44  – December 2023      3 
Policy BriefSince other countries in 2019 fall short of providing a fully 
suitable benchmark to assess China’s situation (given China’s 
leadership, there is no good comparison group), it is useful 
to compare it to the position of very large exporters over the 
past decades.  This comparison confirms China’s particularity. 
For a similar market share in world exports, China invariably 
holds a substantially larger number of product-level dominant 
positions (Figure  2).3 The comparison is meaningful, because 
the world market share reached by China, even in recent 
years, has been surpassed by at least one other big exporter 
(USA, Japan, EU) at some point in time. 
One possible explanation for this could be that China holds 
strong positions in products where, on average, each product 
accounts for a smaller share of world trade, in comparison to 
other products. This is not the case. Measuring the importance 
(3) Figure A.1 in Appendix A shows that the same pattern holds when 
defining product-level dominant positions using 40% or 60% of world trade as 
thresholds instead of our benchmark 50%.of China’s dominant positions through the share of world 
trade covered instead of the number of products does not 
alter qualitatively the result (Figure  3). If anything, China’s 
particularity is even more pronounced according to this metric. 
The current large number of dominant positions for China is 
significant for two reasons. First, it is larger than the number 
of dominant positions held by the EU or the US twenty years 
earlier. In fact, the number of dominant positions reached by 
China recently is comparable to that obtained by the EU and 
the US in the early 1970s (see Figure  4, in which products are 
defined at the more aggregated ISIC 4-digit level). Second, 
the level of overall trade openness is much higher today than 
previously. This implies that a dominant position on world 
export markets has a much larger effect for  destination 
markets today than twenty or fifty years ago. In other words, a 
larger export share today has larger implications since overall 
import penetration is high, compared to the not-too-distant 
past when trade represented a lower share of global goods 
production and consumption.Source:  CEPII (BACI database).

Dominance on World Markets: the China Conundrum  To establish China’s particularity more precisely, we carried 
out product-level econometric estimates of the probability, 
for a given exporter, of enjoying a dominant position in 2019. 
The exporter’s aggregate export market share, as well as its 
squared level, are used as explanatory variables. A dominant 
position is more likely for a large exporter and this relation is 
convex (see column 1 of Table  1), which is consistent with the 
convexity displayed in Figures 1, 2 and 3. In all specifications 
estimated (with or without the square term, including or not 
a dummy for the US and Japan, restricting the sample to the 
US, China, Japan and the EU), China’s specificity stands 
out. An indicator for Chinese exports is always found to be 
positive and statistically significant, showing that, for a given 
aggregate export market share, the probability of enjoying 
a dominant position is on average higher for China than for 
other countries, by 7 to 9  percentage points (see Table  1).  
    2. No straightforward explanation  
for Chinese dominant positions
Establishing that Chinese exports are dominant for a 
surprisingly high number of products raises a number of 
questions and potential explanations. In this section, we check 
to what extent this could be explained by the context of world 
export markets, or by a pattern specific to one or two sectors, 
and whether dominant positions are persistent over time.
2.1. Worldwide export concentration  
is not trending upward
A possible explanation for China’s especially large number 
of dominant positions could lie in a trend toward more 
concentrated world markets. If that were the case, it would be 
reflected in the lead world exporter finding itself more often in 
a dominant position now than it used to be in the past –which 
could help explain China’s specificity. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the data. Over 
the 1997–2019 period, the median, cross-product, of the 
Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of concentration of world 
exports does not show any meaningful trend (Figure  5). For 
products with less concentrated exports, concentration was 
actually trending slightly downward during the 1990s and then 
flat or slightly increasing, as shown by the median and first 
quartile of product-level concentration. Figure 4 – Dominant positions (number of products) and export 
market share (in %): 1970–2018

CEPII  – Policy Brief  No 44  – December 2023      5 
Policy BriefThis is consistent with the results found by Bonfiglioli et al. 
(2021). Based on US imports, they find that concentration 
has fallen in the typical industry, driven by an increase in the 
number of exporting firms (the extensive margin), while at 
the same time average revenue per product of top firms has 
increased. For the most recent period, White et al.  (2023) also 
note that “[o]ver the past five years, the largest economies 
have not systematically diversified the origins of imports”.
For products with more concentrated exports (third quartile), 
a slight downward trend is also visible during the 1990s, 
while an upward trend is found since then. This increasing 
concentration is consistent with the increasing number of 
products dominated by China. However, the number of 
China’s dominant positions already increased from around 
100 to 300 over 1997–2005, a period of stagnating global 
export concentration even for the third quartile of HHI. This 
pattern suggests that the increasing number of China’s 
dominant positions has not been driven by an overall increase 
in export concentration. 
2.2. A specificity spanning a variety  
of sectors
Further analysis shows that a few sectors account for the 
bulk of Chinese dominant positions. This is chiefly the case 
for textiles and wearing apparel, where more or less one 
in three Chinese dominant positions are found in the ten 
years to 2019 ( i.e. around 170  dominant positions; Figure  6). 
This is followed by metal products 
(73 products in 2019), chemicals  (72) 
and electronic products  (43). The “other” 
sector4  accounts for approximately one 
in six dominant positions. 
Assessing sectors’ contributions to 
dominant positions by export value 
instead of number of products delivers 
a different picture (Figure  7). In particular, this illustrates the 
increasing importance of electronic products, accounting for 
approximately one third of the total in recent years. The “other” 
sector still appears as an important contributor, as is the case, 
here, for machinery. In contrast, textiles and wearing apparel 
play only a minor role in terms of value (one ninth to one eighth 
of the total in recent years). This is due to the relatively high 
level of classification detail in these sectors, which overstates 
their importance when it is measured based on the number 
of products compared to value, and potentially by lower unit 
values than other sectors.
(4) The “other” sector includes various manufactured products under chapters 
68 to 71 and 90 to 97 of the HS classifications. It includes ceramic products, 
glass and glassware, stones, optical, measuring or medical instrument or 
apparatus, musical instruments, arms, clock and watches, furniture and toys. 
China’s dominant positions in these sectors include heterogeneous products, 
e.g. ceramic products, glass products and lenses, clocks and parts, seats, 
furniture, lamps, and sport equipment. Given that sectors differ in size (measured by either number 
of products or total exports), this breakdown indicates 
the relative importance of sectors, but not the magnitude 
of China’s specificity within each sector. We address this 
question by extending the econometric analysis presented 
above of the product-level probability of holding a dominant 
position. Introducing a dummy variable for each sector in 
China allows testing whether, given aggregate export market 
share, a dominant position is more likely in China in a given 
sector. The results show that China’s specificity is significant 
within most sectors. It is thus not explained either by China’s 
sector specialization or by its performance in one specific 
sector (Figure  8). Figure 6 – China’s dominant positions (number of products), by sector

Dominance on World Markets: the China Conundrum China’s particularly high incidence of dominant positions is 
far more pronounced in a handful of sectors. The footwear 
sector stands out by the intensity of this specificity, with 
China’s probability of holding a dominant position almost 60% 
larger5 than expected based on Chinese aggregate exports; 
however, its importance in the broad picture is limited, given 
its relatively low share in Chinese total exports (3.4%). Even 
though the incidence of dominant position is less intense in 
their case (approximately 
a 15% higher probability of 
holding a dominant position), 
three sectors account for the 
bulk of China’s specificity: 
textiles, “other” products 
and, most of all, electronic 
products, which account for 
35% of China’s total exports. 
To the extent that “global 
concentration [is]  most 
prominent in electronics”, as emphasized by White et al.  
(2023, p. 6), this result is not surprising; nonetheless, it is 
noteworthy that China’s dominant positions in this area are 
outstanding, even by the sector’s standards. 
(5) The graph reports the coefficient estimated using a logarithm form, and 
exp(0.45)-1=0.58.2.3. China’s dominant positions,  
once acquired, persist over time 
Another relevant dimension of dominant positions is their 
persistence over time. After being acquired, most of China’s 
dominant positions remain dominated by China until the end of 
the period (Figure  9). Specifically, 90% of products dominated 
by China in 2018 are still dominated in 2019. Further back in 
time, 72% of products dominated by China in 2000 or 2010 
are still dominated in 2019. Such persistence is specific to 
China The corresponding figures for the rest of the world’s 
dominant positions are one third lower. Such stability in the 
concentration of exports contrasts with the relative volatility 
of import dependencies identified using the European 
Commission criteria (Vicard and Wibaux, 2023). This pattern 
of persistence further questions the ability of importers to find 
alternative suppliers of these products.
    3. Chinese exporters’ pricing strategy 
is consistent with profit maximization 
in presence of market power 
The statistical evidence presented above consistently 
points toward China holding an exceptionally large number 
of dominant positions on world markets. A first step in 
trying to shed light on the possible underlying explanations 
and mechanisms is to assess how this outcome relates to 
prices. Market shares on world markets depend on price 
competitiveness, which in turn depend on production costs. 
China’s dominant positions could be the consequence of 
very low prices offered by Chinese exporters in a subset of 
products. However, the relationship between market shares, Figure 8 – China’s dominant positions (number of products),

Policy Briefthe country’s market share times the HHI concentration index 
of the country’s exporters on this market, both in the relevant 
year (Nocke and Schutz, 2018). Using this computed average 
exporter market share uncovers a positive relationship 
with prices, which is statistically significant in the case of 
China (but not for France). Chinese exporters do set higher 
prices when they enjoy a higher average market share. The 
difference is sizeable; our estimates suggest that prices are 
17% higher (0.16  log points) for markets belonging to the 
highest decile in terms of market power, compared to the 
lowest decile (Figure  11). 
This finding suggests that Chinese exporters behave in a 
manner consistent with profit maximization. The finding that 
the relationship is more pronounced for China than for France 
could at least partly be related to the country’s size. To dig into 
the plausibility of this hypothesis, we used canonical theoretical 
frameworks from the industrial organization literature to 
compute firms’ predicted average 
mark-up on each market, assuming 
competition is either à la Cournot 
(Appendix Figure  B.1), or à la 
Bertrand (Appendix Figure  B.2). 
The upward-sloping relationship 
between export prices and market 
power is even clearer in these 
theory-based estimates than in the 
“naïve” ones presented in Figure  11. 
This is especially true assuming Bertrand competition, with a 
26% difference in average prices between the top and bottom 
deciles in terms of market share. prices and costs is more subtle than that. A larger market share 
confers greater market power, which leads profit-maximizing 
firms to increase their price-cost margin (mark-up). 
In order to analyze and compare pricing strategies and their 
relation to export market shares, we rely on product-level export 
data, as well as firm-level concentration across exporters by 
destination, in two countries for which the necessary data are 
available: China and France. (More details on the methodology 
are given in the Appendix C.)
We start by assessing the raw data. If exporters coordinate 
their pricing strategies, this would be reflected in a different 
relationship across markets (defined here as a given product 
in a given destination market in 
a given year) between average 
price and export market share. 
Figure  10 suggests that this is 
not the case. After controlling for 
destination- and product-specific 
factors for the year concerned 
(through fixed effects), prices do 
not appear to be systematically 
related to market share, neither 
for Chinese nor for French exports. While some differences 
are observed across deciles, they remain low and statistically 
insignificant. These results do not lend support to the notion that 
Chinese exporters coordinate their export pricing strategies.
For uncoordinated exporters, the pricing strategy is not 
influenced by the exporting country’s total market share, but 
rather by the average market share of the average exporter in 
the country. This average can be approximated by multiplying after being acquired, 
most of China’s 
dominant positions 
remain dominated 
by China until the 
end of the periodFigure 10 – Prices and aggregate market shares (by

Dominance on World Markets: the China Conundrum We then examine in more detail the relationship depicted 
in Figure  11. We use the theory-based predicted mark-ups, 
market by market, as explanatory variables of market-specific 
average export prices. For both France and China, the 
estimates show a positive and significant coefficient for this 
variable (Appendix Table  2). This is consistent with the cruder 
results by decile in Figure  11. The more accurate assessment 
allowed by this method demonstrates that the relationship is 
statistically significant even for France. However, the positive 
relationship between predicted markups and prices is far 
stronger for China in all specifications.6 
While the difference with France is difficult to interpret a 
priori, the results for China are consistent with canonical 
theoretical frameworks.7 In other words, this analysis shows 
that differences across markets in Chinese export prices 
are consistent with competitive behavior between profit-
maximizing Chinese exporters. 
To be clear, this has no relation 
with possible distortions in the 
allocation of resources across 
sectors, whatever their form. 
This finding refers only to 
the behavior of firms within a 
given sector and does not say 
anything about the average 
price level set by Chinese 
exporters. The analysis does 
not preclude interference of 
the Chinese authorities in the 
sectoral composition of the economy. What it does show is 
that there is a strong relationship between market shares and 
prices, mediated (predicted) by mark-ups. Destination markets 
(country-by-product) in which China has a dominant position 
exhibit higher, not lower prices. The tight relationship between 
market shares, mark-ups and prices implies that there is some 
loss of consumer welfare in markets where China commands 
a large share, and that this loss may be considerable in 
markets in which China has a dominant position.
(6) Due to data availability for China, the analysis above is carried out for 
exports to European (plus Turkey and UK) destination markets (we do not 
have HHI concentration measures for Chinese exporters in other markets). 
This may raise a concern about the results for French exporters, whose 
behaviour may be different in other, non-European markets. To address this 
issue, we extend the dataset for France alone to include its non-European 
export destinations and estimate the same relationships in non-European 
destinations. The results, reported in Appendix Table B.1, show that, while 
predicted mark-ups for French exporters show a stronger explanatory power 
for prices outside the EU than within it, this relation remains much weaker 
than for China.
(7) In theory, the coefficient for predicted mark-ups in explaining prices should 
be equal to one, while our estimates for China lie between 0.5 and 1.1.    Conclusion
At a time when trade relations are increasingly seen through 
the lens of potential vulnerabilities, the concentration of 
exports on world markets has attracted much attention. 
When an exporter accounts for an overwhelming share of 
world exports of a specific product, it implies that it would 
be difficult for many importers to substitute this supplier for 
another, at least in the short term. Such dominant positions 
may raise concerns about the vulnerability of importers, while 
exporters enjoying such a strong export position may be given 
substantial leverage. 
Defining dominant positions as a situation where one country 
accounts for more than half of total world exports, this Policy 
Brief shows that China is different from other countries. Even 
when the volume of its aggregate exports is taken into account, 
it holds far more dominant positions. This finding proves robust 
to different measures and benchmarks, including in the past 
25 years, and including using detailed, product-level data. It 
is not confined to a single sector but spans several important 
ones (chiefly electronics, but also textiles/wearing apparel, 
footwear and machinery). A fine-grained analysis based on 
individual firms’ average market share suggests that this has 
consequences for pricing behavior, where Chinese firms use 
their market power to charge significant mark-ups, much more 
than French exporters.
The exceptionally large number of China’s dominant positions 
remains a conundrum. We cannot exclude that this result is 
related to the peculiar nature of the Chinese economy, where 
the Communist Party and the state play an unusually important 
coordination and intervention role; 
investigating whether this is the 
case requires further research. 
What we can say is that China’s 
dominant position stands out in 
the recent historical context, and 
that it is consequential, at least for 
prices charged on foreign markets. 
While prices of Chinese imports 
may be lower than close substitutes, our analysis indicates that 
they could be still lower if  Chinese exporters did not exploit 
their market power. We hope this work will attract attention to 
China’s unprecedented number of dominant positions, and spur 
new research to dig into its causes and its consequences.differences across

1 Market shares, markups and prices
Our methodology builds on Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and Neary (2016), which are models of nested
constant elasticity of substitution (CES) multi-product oligopoly.1Consumers in some destination market
consume many goods, and substitute across these goods with elasticity η. Within each good gthere can
be many varieties (differentiated by brands, firms, source countries, etc.). Within a good g, consumers
substitute across varieties with elasticity σg. Suppliers have monopoly power of varying degrees over their
varieties. When setting their prices suppliers act strategically, and take into account their influence on other
suppliers within a good, but ignore the potential influence their actions may have on other goods.
We model competition within a good either a la Bertrand (price competition) or a la Cournot (competi-
tion on quantities). In both cases, a supplier that commands a greater share of the market (in equilibrium)
also charges a higher mark-up (the difference between price and costs) within that market.
Consider the market share of a supplier ωfrom origin country oselling in destination dgood g,Sodg(ω).
It is convenient to start by computing the Lerner index, which is the difference between price and marginal
cost as a share of the price, L=(P−MC)/P. If competition is a la Bertrand, then the Lerner index is
LB
odg(ω)=1
σg[1−Sodg(ω)] +ηSodg(ω)(1)
and if firms compete a la Cournot, then
LC
odg(ω)=1
σg[1−Sodg(ω)] +1
ηSodg(ω). (2)
Here we assume that ηandσgdo not vary by destination. We then use the Lerner index to compute markups.
µ=P/M C =1/(1−L). (3)
2 Measuring market shares and elasticities
In order to measure the markup that is mandated by the model delineated above, we must have information
onη,σgandSodg(ω). Previous applications of this model have used η= 1 (or slightly above). This implies
constant expenditure shares and very little substitutability across goods within a destination. Given the
high degree of disaggregation that we use (HS 6-digit), we think that this value is too low, and we use η= 2.
The results are not qualitatively affected when we use higher values of η. We obtain estimates of σgfrom
CEPII’s Product Level Trade Elasticities database.2
We do not observe firm level data, so we compute market shares at the origin, destination and product
level. Breinlich, Fadinger, Nocke & Schutz (2022)3show that the average market share of exporters from an

1 Market shares, markups and prices
Our methodology builds on Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and Neary (2016), which are models of nested
constant elasticity of substitution (CES) multi-product oligopoly.1Consumers in some destination market
consume many goods, and substitute across these goods with elasticity η. Within each good gthere can
be many varieties (differentiated by brands, firms, source countries, etc.). Within a good g, consumers
substitute across varieties with elasticity σg. Suppliers have monopoly power of varying degrees over their
varieties. When setting their prices suppliers act strategically, and take into account their influence on other
suppliers within a good, but ignore the potential influence their actions may have on other goods.
We model competition within a good either a la Bertrand (price competition) or a la Cournot (competi-
tion on quantities). In both cases, a supplier that commands a greater share of the market (in equilibrium)
also charges a higher mark-up (the difference between price and costs) within that market.
Consider the market share of a supplier ωfrom origin country oselling in destination dgood g,Sodg(ω).
It is convenient to start by computing the Lerner index, which is the difference between price and marginal
cost as a share of the price, L=(P−MC)/P. If competition is a la Bertrand, then the Lerner index is
LB
odg(ω)=1
σg[1−Sodg(ω)] +ηSodg(ω)(1)
and if firms compete a la Cournot, then
LC
odg(ω)=1
σg[1−Sodg(ω)] +1
ηSodg(ω). (2)
Here we assume that ηandσgdo not vary by destination. We then use the Lerner index to compute markups.
µ=P/M C =1/(1−L). (3)
2 Measuring market shares and elasticities
In order to measure the markup that is mandated by the model delineated above, we must have information
onη,σgandSodg(ω). Previous applications of this model have used η= 1 (or slightly above). This implies
constant expenditure shares and very little substitutability across goods within a destination. Given the
high degree of disaggregation that we use (HS 6-digit), we think that this value is too low, and we use η= 2.
The results are not qualitatively affected when we use higher values of η. We obtain estimates of σgfrom
CEPII’s Product Level Trade Elasticities database.2
We do not observe firm level data, so we compute market shares at the origin, destination and product
level. Breinlich, Fadinger, Nocke & Schutz (2022)3show that the average market share of exporters from an

Policy Brieforigin oin a destination dand good gis approximately equal to the origin country’s market share times the
Herfindahl–Hirschman Index of exporters along those same dimensions:
Sodg≃Sodg×HHI odg (4)
times a term that varies only by destination market. We will ignore this term here as we will absorb this
using destination fixed effects in the application below. We have HHI odgfor only two origin countries:
China and France. This constrains our analysis to these countries.
Another difficulty arises from the fact that while we observe trade flows at the HS 6-digit level, we do not
observe total expenditure on a good in a destination at the same level of aggregation. Therefore, in order to
compute Sodgwe use the share of export sales (obtained from CEPII’s BACI dataset), Sx
odgtimes the share
of total imports in total expenditure on good gin destination d,
Sodg=Sx
odg×(1−Sddg). (5)
The share of domestic firms in total expenditure Sddgis available from CEPII’s TradeProd dataset, but only
at a higher level of aggregation (9 manufacturing industries).4This turns (5) into
Sodg≃Sx
odg×(1−Sdd,i (g)), (6)
where i(g) denotes the industry that includes good g. Eventually, we use
Sodg≃Sx
odg×(1−Sdd,i (g))×HHI odg (7)
as our measure of the average market share of firms from oin destination din good g. We use Sodginstead
ofSodg(ω) to compute average Lerner indices and corresponding average markups.
3 Application
We use (3) to compute “predicted markups” µodgfor the two countries for which we have the HHI data to
do so: China and France. Without loss of generality, we can now drop the origin index.
If the model were a perfect predictor of prices and markups given marginal costs, then we could write
Pdg=µdgMC dg, (8)
where Pdgis the observed price inclusive of monopoly power and MC dgincludes the impact of trade barriers.
In this case, we can write
Pdg=µdgMC gτdg, (9)
where MC gis the marginal production cost and τdgcaptures ad valorem trade barriers. Taking logs we can
write
lnPdg= ln µdg+ ln MC g+ ln τdg. (10)
We estimate a version of (10) separately for China and France. If trade barriers have component that is
good-specific (e.g., MFN) and another one that is destination specific (in fact, bilateral), then we can write
lnPdg= ln µdg+ ln MC g+ ln τd+ ln τg. (11)
We absorb ln MC gand ln τdwith good and destination fixed effects, respectively. If good-specific trade
barrier variation is not correlated with market shares and mark-ups from a given origin (they should not if
these are non-discriminatory, like MFN tariffs), then the following regression
lnPdg=βlnµdg+αg+αd+εdg, (12)
will be an unbiased and consistent estimator of the influence of markups on prices, where αgand αdare
good and destination specific fixed effects, respectively. The destination specific fixed effects also correct for
the missing destination-specific component in (4).
