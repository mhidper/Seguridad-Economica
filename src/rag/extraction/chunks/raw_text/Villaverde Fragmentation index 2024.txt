Abstract
After decades of rising global economic integration, the world economy is fragmenting.
To measure this phenomenon, we introduce an index of geopolitical fragmentation based
on a dynamic factor model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility. We
then employ structural vector autoregressions and local projections to assess the causal
effects of changes in fragmentation. Increased fragmentation negatively impacts the
global economy, with emerging economies suffering more than advanced ones. Notably,
fragmentation has an immediate negative effect, while the benefits of reduced fragmen-
tation unfold gradually. A sectoral analysis reveals that industries closely linked to
global markets are more adversely affected. Finally, we highlight significant differences
in the impacts of fragmentation across various geopolitical blocs.

1 Introduction
Following decades of increasing global economic integration, the world economy shifted course
after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Events such as Brexit, the invasion of Ukraine, and
conflicts in the Middle East have strained international relations and prompted policymakers
to reconsider their nations’ economic strategies. Free trade agreements, once common, have
become rare and the number of trade-restricting measures implemented in 2022 nearly tripled
compared to 2019. Consequently, households, firms, and governments are reassessing their
operations amid growing geopolitical and trade complexities. For more detailed discussions
on this geopolitical fragmentation and its impact on the world economy, see Aiyar et al.
(2023a) and Gopinath (2023).
Various indicators reveal discernible trends in this ongoing geopolitical fragmentation: a
global slowdown in the flows of goods and capital, increased restrictions on trade and foreign
direct investment, heightened political risks, more frequent sanctions and conflicts, tighter
capital controls, and growing concerns related to migration. However, no single measure of
geopolitical fragmentation fully captures the current state of global economic integration, as
each indicator only addresses one aspect of it. Thus, choosing one indicator over another (or
an average of them) to study the evolution and implications of geopolitical fragmentation can
be arbitrary and may lead to incorrect conclusions or policy recommendations.
Dynamic factor models (DFMs) offer a way to create a comprehensive index of geopolitical
fragmentation —a numerical measurement of this multifaceted process. The main idea behind
a DFM, as pioneered by Sargent and Sims (1977), Geweke (1977), and Stock and Watson
(1989), is that many observed indicators of a phenomenon (such as the business cycle or, in
our case, geopolitical fragmentation) are driven by a common unobserved factor. While each
indicator is inherently imperfect and contaminated by idiosyncratic noise, we can employ
a likelihood-based approach to estimate the unobserved index that captures the underlying
dynamics of interest.
The DFM approach has gained popularity because it is data-driven and minimizes the
subjective decisions a researcher needs to make. Specifically, we propose a state-of-the-art
DFM with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility. Our flexible specification can
accommodate missing observations and handle data with different frequencies.
There are two main reasons for estimating such a factor. First, it allows us to gauge
the evolution of geopolitical fragmentation. An increase in the factor indicates that the
world economy is becoming more fragmented, thus providing a quantitative confirmation (or
refutation) of more casual assessments and mitigating the possible confirmatory bias present
in many qualitative evaluations by experts. Second, the estimated factor can be used as an
input for other empirical analyses, such as a variable in a structural vector autoregression
(SVAR) or a linear projection (LP) for causality assessment. This enables us to translate
2
changes in the factor (e.g., an increase by 1 standard deviation) into concrete effects on
aggregate variables with a sharp economic interpretation (e.g., a 0.3% reduction in GDP).
Our principal aim is to establish an index designed for broad usage, serving the needs of
policymakers, practitioners, and academics alike.
After introducing the indicators we employ and discussing our econometric methodology,
we present the evolution of our estimated factor. This index reveals three distinct phases.
First, there was a period of relative stability in geopolitical fragmentation from 1975 to the
early 1990s. Fragmentation then decreased as the collapse of the Soviet Union and market-
oriented reforms across many countries led to a spike in globalization. However, following
the 2007-2008 financial crisis, geopolitical fragmentation has increased to its highest levels
in the sample, with no signs of reversal. Our estimation results align broadly with narrative
approaches that have discussed the evolution of geopolitical fragmentation based on narrative
evidence (e.g., Gopinath, 2023). We extensively document the robustness of our index and
compare it with a principal components analysis.
Next, we use our index as an input for causality analysis exercises with SVARs and LPs.
Our analysis reveals that a positive one-standard-deviation shock to the fragmentation index
(considered adverse) has a detrimental impact on the global economy, with more pronounced
negative effects observed in emerging economies compared to advanced economies. The im-
pacts reveal an asymmetry: fragmentation has an immediate negative effect on the global
economy, while the positive effects of reduced fragmentation (viewed as an aspect of globaliza-
tion) unfold with lags. Our findings remain robust under different identification assumptions
(e.g., different orderings of variables or a narrative approach), and when considering various
control variables, as in Caldara and Iacoviello (2022).
To elucidate the economic channels through which fragmentation influences the economy,
we scrutinize sectors within OECD economies. The sectoral analysis highlights the adverse
effects on industries closely linked to global markets, such as manufacturing, construction,
finance, and wholesale and retail trade. Conversely, sectors like agriculture, forestry, fishing,
real estate, and public services, which are more insulated from global markets, experience
only marginal effects. This sectoral pattern is particularly evident in the case of the U.S.
Finally, we examine the effects of the world economy’s fragmentation into increasingly
separate geopolitical blocs. We find notable differences in the level of fragmentation among
different blocs, such as the U.S.-EU bloc vs. the China-Russia bloc. Fragmentation shocks
in the U.S.-EU bloc lead to more pronounced global effects than those in the China-Russia
bloc, highlighting the unique characteristics of the latter economic relationship.
Our paper contributes to the expanding literature on geopolitical fragmentation (e.g.,
Attinasi et al., 2023, Blanga-Gubbay and Rubinova, 2023, Bolhuis et al., 2023, Campos
et al., 2023, Cerdeiro et al., 2021, Clayton et al., 2024, G´ oes and Bekkers, 2022, Hakobyan
et al., 2023, Javorcik et al., 2024, and Utar et al., 2023), building on the summaries provided
3
by Aiyar et al. (2023a) and Gopinath (2023). This literature sheds light on the associated
costs, which include the unwinding of gains from globalization, encompassing trade (e.g.,
Frankel and Romer, 1999; Feenstra, 2006; Gorodnichenko et al., 2012), technology diffusion
and adoption (e.g., Bartelme and Gorodnichenko, 2015; Bustos, 2011; Acemoglu et al., 2015),
cross-border labor and capital flows (e.g., Glennon, 2024; Erten et al., 2021), and international
risk sharing (e.g., Obstfeld, 1994). Our paper adds to this body of work by quantifying the
causal effects of fragmentation on aggregate economic variables. While existing papers focus
on a single or a few indicators of fragmentation (e.g., Antr´ as, 2020, Goldberg and Reed, 2023,
and Gopinath et al., 2024), our DFM aggregates a wide range of measures of fragmentation.
Geopolitical tensions contribute to increased uncertainty regarding future policies and the
ultimate shape of a fragmented world (e.g., Caldara et al., 2020). The direct costs of trade
disruptions include tariffs, inefficiencies from reduced specialization, resource misallocation,
diminished economies of scale, and decreased competition (e.g., Melitz and Trefler, 2012).
Aiyar et al. (2023a) point out that short-term transition costs stemming from trade disrup-
tions tend to be more pronounced due to the low elasticities of substitution in the short run.
In contrast, losses from technological decoupling may materialize over the medium and long
term. Our empirical findings point out the importance of those longer-horizon considerations.
Moreover, our empirical results confirm the previous findings that the impact of these costs
may vary across countries. As highlighted by Aiyar et al. (2023a), geoeconomic fragmentation
disproportionately affects emerging markets and low-income countries that have the potential
for catch-up through trade and financial and technological integration. Gopinath (2023) and
Gopinath et al. (2024) add that if disruptions occur primarily between large blocs (e.g., a
U.S.-Europe bloc and a China-Russia bloc), some countries, particularly in Latin America or
Southeast Asia, may experience gains as “neutral” bystanders.
Given the multiple channels of impact and potential heterogeneity described above, the
examination of the cost of fragmentation is an empirical question. The literature has in-
vestigated the economic consequences of recent fragmentation episodes, such as Brexit (e.g.,
Sampson, 2017, and Bloom et al., 2019) and the U.S.-China trade war in 2018-19 (e.g., Flaaen
and Pierce, 2019; Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2022; Fajgelbaum et al., 2019). A few studies
(G´ oes and Bekkers, 2022, Cerdeiro et al., 2021, and Bolhuis et al., 2023) develop general
equilibrium international trade models to estimate the cost of fragmentation. Our SVAR and
LP estimates add new findings to these previous results.
Finally, our paper contributes to the existing body of literature focused on formulating
indices or metrics. This includes assessments of uncertainty (e.g., Jurado et al., 2015, and
Baker et al., 2016), geopolitical risks (e.g., Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022), economic state eval-
uations (e.g., Aruoba et al., 2009, and Shapiro et al., 2022), investor sentiment analysis (e.g.,
Baker and Wurgler, 2007), corporate credit market scrutiny (e.g., Gilchrist and Zakrajˇ sek,
2012), shadow rate investigations (e.g., Wu and Xia, 2016), and considerations of measures
4
related to the COVID-19 pandemic as presented by Arias et al. (2023), along with disruptions
in the supply chain discussed by Bai et al. (2024).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we examine common empir-
ical indicators of geopolitical fragmentation. Section 3 introduces a DFM and produces the
geopolitical fragmentation index. Section 4 explores a principal components alternative to our
baseline DFM. Section 5 assesses the causal impact of geopolitical fragmentation on economic
aggregates. Section 6 measures fragmentation by geopolitical blocs. Section 7 concludes. The
Appendix provides additional information and robustness exercises.
2 Empirical Indicators of Geopolitical Fragmentation
We compile 14 widely used indicators of geopolitical fragmentation from the literature, each
capturing an aspect of the emerging trends. However, no single indicator synthesizes all the
relevant information. By combining these indicators using a likelihood-based approach, we
aim to extract a more accurate measure of geopolitical fragmentation.
The methodology we present in Section 3 is not dependent on the specific choice of these
14 indicators. Our econometric approach can accommodate more or fewer indicators, and
as new indicators become available, we can incorporate them into our index or use them to
replace existing ones. Nonetheless, we argue that the 14 indicators we have selected provide a
comprehensive survey of existing measures, and our estimates will be robust even if different
subsets of these indicators are excluded.
2.1 Data sources for geopolitical fragmentation indicators
We begin by listing each indicator and its sources:
1. The trade openness ratio, (export+import)/GDP, from the International Financial
Statistics (IFS).
2. The FDI ratio, calculated as FDI/GDP, from the IFS.
3. The financial flow ratio, (portfolio investment+other investment)/GDP, from the IFS.
4. The migration flow ratio, net migration flows as a percentage of the population, from
UN World Population Prospects.
5. The patent flows, from International Patent and Citations across Sectors (INPACT-S)
compiled by LaBelle et al. (2023).
6. The number of trade restrictions, from the Global Trade Alert.
5
7. The capital control measure, from Fern´ andez et al. (2016).
8. The number of sanctions, from Felbermayr et al. (2020).
9. The geopolitical risk index, from Caldara and Iacoviello (2022).
10. The trade policy uncertainty, from Caldara et al. (2020).
11. The energy uncertainty, from Dang et al. (2023).
12. The migration fear index, from Bloom et al. (2015).
13. The number of international conflicts, based on the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.
14. The UN General Assembly kappa score, from H¨ age (2017).
The detailed descriptions of the indicators are provided in Appendix D.1. Panel (A)
of Figure 1 presents the time series plot for each indicator. Most of the indicators that
signal fragmentation (e.g., the capital control measure or the number of sanctions) move
upward at the end of the sample, while many of the indicators that measure integration
(e.g., trade openness or the financial flow ratio) stagnate. Panel (B) includes informative
summary statistics, including the non-stationarity test and pairwise correlations between
each indicator and trade openness (calculated using annual aggregated data for the available
sample). The main pattern from these correlations is that, although we observe evidence of
comovement among indicators, there is also substantial evidence of idiosyncratic behavior.
This observation reinforces our motivation of aggregating all indicators into a synthetic one.
2.2 Discussion
Next, we offer a literature review summarizing the appeal of our 14 indicators of geopolitical
fragmentation and addressing associated caveats. We categorize these indicators into four
areas: (i) those measuring economic integration, (ii) those gauging policy implementation,
(iii) those derived from text mining, and (iv) those offering insights into political dynamics.
2.2.1 Metrics of economic integration
Globalization encompasses the interconnectedness and interdependence of economic and po-
litical systems worldwide. Driven by advancements enabling the free flow of goods, services,
capital, ideas, and people across borders, its progress is gauged by indicators such as trade
openness, FDI, financial flows as a proportion of GDP, migration flow relative to population,
and cross-border patent flows ( indicators 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 ). For instance, Aiyar et al. (2023b)
and Gopinath (2023) described different phases of globalization using the trade openness met-
ric and pointed out that the remarkable increases in trade since the 1980s have stagnated

since 2008. This phenomenon is often referred to as “slowbalization.” A similar deceleration
is observed in FDI and financial flows. As Gopinath (2023) puts it:
“Since 2008, however, the pace of globalization has stagnated—the so-called slow-
balization—with trade to GDP stabilizing as the forces that helped spur hyper-
globalization naturally waned.”
(IMF First Managing Deputy Director Gita Gopinath — the 20th World Congress of the
International Economic Association, December 2023)
However, interpreting these dynamics requires caution, as several factors, not exclusively
tied to globalization or fragmentation, might influence the indicators. For instance, develop-
ing countries may witness a decline in trade share due to weak domestic aggregate demand
and shifts in economic structures (e.g., the expansion of non-tradable service sectors in de-
veloped countries). Moreover, economic and financial cycles play a crucial role in trade,
financial, and migration flows.
2.2.2 Policy implementation gauges
The dynamics of macro aggregates partly mirror underlying policy actions aimed at facilitat-
ing or impeding international flows, including the imposition or removal of trade restrictions
(indicator 6 ) and capital control measures ( indicator 7 ). While these policy measures directly
impact fragmentation, quantifying them is challenging. Policy measures are often specific to
individual countries, and their significance varies based on particular contexts. The litera-
ture has devoted much effort to converting qualitative information into quantitative measures.
For instance, Fern´ andez et al. (2016) developed a quantitative measure of a country’s cap-
ital control strength using diverse information, including qualitative descriptions from the
IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions ( indicator 7 ).
Since international flow restrictions may manifest as economic sanctions, Felbermayr et al.
(2020) compiled various sanction types, ranging from trade and financial sanctions to military
assistance ( indicator 8 ).
However, uncertainties persist regarding the scope of policy actions to be considered
and the relevance of each measure. Additionally, databases may have limited time periods,
constrained by the availability of consistently high-quality information over time.
2.2.3 Text-mining-derived indicators
Recent advancements in text mining have enabled the extraction of quantitative information
from extensive text data. In particular, numerous studies in the literature have crafted
indices relevant to fragmentation. These encompass geopolitical events (e.g., war, terrorism,
and tensions among countries and political actors) and their associated risks (Caldara and
8
Iacoviello, 2022, indicator 9 ); uncertainty regarding trade policies (Caldara et al., 2020,
indicator 10 ); energy uncertainty, often linked to geopolitical tensions (Dang et al., 2023,
indicator 11 ); and concerns related to migration flows (Bloom et al., 2015, indicator 12 ).
Such indices may capture the latest developments in geopolitical situations or individuals’
sentiments about them, which might not be reflected in “hard” data on economic and financial
activities.
2.2.4 Political reflections
Another crucial aspect of fragmentation is political alignment, where tensions between coun-
tries can potentially escalate into violent conflicts. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program
provides a comprehensive set of conflict information based on global and local news articles
(indicator 13 ). However, political misalignments do not need to translate into direct actions
against a country. In such instances, previous studies often turn to the voting behavior in
the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). These studies gauge the degree of political
alignment by assessing the similarity in UNGA voting patterns between countries. H¨ age
(2017) builds on those ideas by constructing the “kappa score,” which adjusts the observed
variability of countries’ bilateral voting outcomes based on each country’s votes around its
average vote ( indicator 14 ).
2.3 Taking stock
Our previous discussion highlighted the discernible trends in geopolitical fragmentation ap-
parent across various indicators categorized into four areas. These trends include a global
deceleration in the flows of goods and capital, heightened restrictions on trade and foreign
direct investment, increased political risks, sanctions, and conflicts, as well as capital controls
and concerns related to migration.
How can we quantify the dynamics of comovements within this set of empirical indicators
and extract the common information present in all of them? A simple average seems unsatis-
factory: there is no a priori reason why one indicator should weigh as much as another, and
an arbitrary weight seems even less appropriate. Can we let the data decide how to weigh
each indicator? In the next section, we propose a methodology to address this task.
3 Measuring Geopolitical Fragmentation
In this section, we argue that we can consider the level of geopolitical fragmentation to
be an unobservable variable and that each indicator is a noise measure of it. If we take this
perspective, we can adopt a likelihood-based approach and let the indicators’ dynamics select
the optimal weights that will yield an estimate of this unobservable variable.
9
To do so, we can postulate a flexible DFM with time-varying coefficients and stochastic
volatility to account for potential parameter instability and changing uncertainty. Our ap-
proach is designed to capture the evolving comovement among time series by allowing their
dependence on a common factor to change over time in flexible ways.
Factor models have been integral to the economist’s toolkit since the unobservable index
models proposed by Sargent and Sims (1977) and Geweke (1977). The pioneering work
of Stock and Watson (1989) further solidified their significance, aiming to extract valuable
information from a broad cross-section of macroeconomic time series for forecasting purposes.
Our DFM description builds on the foundations of Del Negro and Otrok (2008) and Del Negro
and Schorfheide (2011), utilizing Bayesian techniques for estimation. This methodology can
be traced back to Geweke and Zhou (1996) and Otrok and Whiteman (1998).
3.1 Specification
Leti∈ {1, ..., N}be the set of indices for the different indicators of geopolitical fragmentation.
In our case, N= 14, but it could be any other finite natural number, with only the limitation
of computational capabilities. The value that each indicator takes at time tis then yi,t.
We assume that the dynamics of the yi,tis driven by a common factor ft:
yi,t=ai,t+bi,tft+ui,t, (1)
which we interpret as the true state of geopolitical fragmentation. In equation (1), the mean
ai,t, slope bi,t, and error ui,tdepend both on the empirical indicator and time. In that way, we
incorporate much flexibility in how the factor is linked with the empirical indicators. Later,
in Section 3.6, we will explore the possibility of increasing the number of factors.
We assume that ai,tandbi,tevolve as:
ai,t=ai,0+ai,1t,
bi,t=bi,t−1+σbiϵbi,t, ϵ bi,t∼ N(0,1).
First, we address non-stationarity in the proxies yi,tby incorporating a deterministic time
trend ai,torthogonal to the common factor ft. This is crucial, as demonstrated in Panel
(B) of Figure 1, where some indicators exhibit non-stationarity while others do not. The
assumption underlying our approach is that the common dynamics across empirical indicators
are captured by their stationary or cyclical components. Second, we accommodate time-
varying sensitivities bi,tof individual proxies with respect to the common factor ftthrough a
random-walk process, capturing potential slow-moving variations. This flexibility is crucial,
as certain indicators may reveal more about geopolitical fragmentation than others, and their
importance can change over time.
10
In comparison, we model the factor and the error as autoregressive processes:
ft=ϕf,1ft−1+...+ϕf,pft−p+σf,tϵf,t, ϵ f,t∼ N(0,1),
ui,t=ϕui,1ui,t−1+...+ϕui,qui,t−q+σui,tϵui,t, ϵ ui,t∼ N(0,1).
We allow the individual error terms ui,tto exhibit serial correlation, capturing dynamics
that do not comove and are idiosyncratic to each series. This approach involves relaxing
the assumption that all dynamics arise solely from the factor. The rationale behind this
adjustment is to prevent the factor estimates from becoming overly dependent on a subset of
empirical indicators that exhibit high persistence.
Finally, the innovation variances, σk,t, are time-varying:
σk,t=σkexp(hk,t),
hk,t=hk,t−1+σhkϵhk,t, ϵ hk,t∼ N(0,1), k∈ {f, u 1, ..., u N}.
This attribute holds for both the innovations to the common factor and those associated with
the idiosyncratic error terms. The incorporation of stochastic volatility is crucial not only
for modeling the non-Gaussian features inherent in the data, but also for capturing outlier
events that may occur in certain years, both for the factor and the idiosyncratic terms. This
dynamic approach allows the model to adapt to changing volatility patterns, offering a more
robust representation of the underlying dynamics in the empirical indicators.
Compiling all the previous equations, we get the complete specification of our DFM:
yi,t=ai,t+bi,tft+ui,t,
ai,t=ai,0+ai,1t,
bi,t=bi,t−1+σbiϵbi,t, ϵ bi,t∼ N(0,1),
ft=ϕf,1ft−1+...+ϕf,pft−p+σf,tϵf,t, ϵ f,t∼ N(0,1),
ui,t=ϕui,1ui,t−1+...+ϕui,qui,t−q+σui,tϵui,t, ϵ ui,t∼ N(0,1),
σk,t=σkexp(hk,t),
hk,t=hk,t−1+σhkϵhk,t, ϵ hk,t∼ N(0,1), k∈ {f, u 1, ..., u N}. (2)
3.2 Priors
We pick loose priors for the model parameters to introduce greater flexibility and reduce
the sensitivity of estimation results to the choice of prior distributions. More concretely,
our priors exhibit symmetry across a range of empirical indicators related to geopolitical
11
fragmentation i∈ {1, ..., N}, where for k∈ {f, ui}andg∈ {ui, hf, hui}:
ai="

Our priors embody the belief that the degree of time variation in the factor loading σ2
bi
is smaller than the variations in the idiosyncratic error terms or the stochastic volatilities.
However, for both cases, the weight of the prior relative to the sample for variances is not
adjusted, leading to a substantial reduction in the impact of the prior as the sample length
increases. We additionally explore a scenario wherein the factor loading biremains constant
over time, and we adopt a loose prior, which is centered around one with a substantial variance
ofN 

. Section 3.8 will discuss the robustness of our results to different priors.
3.3 Estimation
The estimation procedure for our DFM utilizes a Gibbs sampler to draw samples from the
exact finite sample joint posterior distribution of both the parameters and the latent state
variables, including the common factor. We extend the Gibbs sampler proposed by Del Negro
and Otrok (2008), focusing on addressing the challenges associated with handling missing data
and discrepancies in data frequencies, specifically pertaining to stock variables rather than
flow variables. Appendix A describes the modifications we introduce.
We set the lag order for ftandui,tto be one, and we pick the time frame for our 14
indicators to be from 1975:Q1 to 2022:Q4. We also standardized them to have zero sample
mean and unit standard deviation. The purpose of this standardization is to ensure that all
the indicators contribute to the measurement of geopolitical fragmentation comparably. The
trade openness ratio, the FDI ratio, the financial flow ratio, the migration flow ratio, and the
patent flows are multiplied by −1 to account for their inverse correlation with the underlying
object of interest. This adjustment facilitates the imposition of symmetric priors for factor
loading across the various empirical indicators.
In instances where data are only accessible on an annual basis, the variables are charac-
terized as stock rather than flow variables. These variables capture values at specific points
in time, much like snapshots of the economy. Handling missing observations in this context
is straightforward as discussed in Aruoba et al. (2009). For the annual series, we assume that
the individual error terms associated with them are not serially correlated.
12
In equation (1), there exist three sets of latent states: ft,bi,t, and hk,t. All of these
necessitate initialization or normalization. To mitigate the indeterminacy concerning sign
and magnitude for factor loadings bi,tand factor levels ft, we initialize the values for bi,0to
one. The initialization values for f0andhk,0are set to zero, with the specific value for f0
being non-crucial. In addition, we set the variance of innovation to the common factor to one,
denoted as σf= 1. Del Negro and Otrok (2008) present a more comprehensive discussion on
the identification of a DFM with time-varying loadings and stochastic volatilities.
3.4 Results
In Figure 2, we display the posterior median (smoothed) estimates of ft,our geopolitical
fragmentation index, alongside 90% credible intervals. To aid interpretation, we overlay
major historical events influencing globalization. As shown in Figure 1, certain indicators
were unavailable until the mid-1990s, leading to wider credible intervals up to that period.
Thus, our estimate is more sensitive to individual indicators during the initial periods from
1975 to 1995 but becomes more robust post-1995.

Notes: Posterior median-smoothed estimates of ftaccompanied by 90% credible intervals. We overlay with
major historical events.
Our estimated fragmentation index aligns well with the narrative understanding of geopo-
13
litical fragmentation, as noted in Gopinath (2023). Our median estimate of fragmentation
was stable between 1975 and the early 1990s. While trade openness was increasing, the world
economy was still divided between the market economy and socialist blocs. Other indicators,
like the FDI ratio or the financial flow rate, did not show much of an upward trend.
Our index reports an upward trajectory in globalization starting from the mid-1990s. Key
events contributing to this trend include the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Maastricht
Treaty and the formation of the European Union, the establishment of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), and China’s entry into the WTO. In fact, these were the years when
the term ”globalization” became popular outside of economics.
This trend shifted post-2008, experiencing a notable upswing coinciding with the 2007-
2008 financial crisis. The subsequent decade witnessed a significant surge, reflecting height-
ened challenges in global trade and capital flows driven by geopolitical events (e.g., conflicts,
trade tensions) and the global pandemic. The process of geopolitical fragmentation has not
reverted by the end of the sample, although there are some weak indications of a slowdown
in fragmentation after the end of the worst phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Notes: Posterior median estimates accompanied by 90% credible intervals.
To understand better which observations are driving our estimated index, Figure 3 reports
the posterior estimates and 90% credible intervals for the factor loadings and volatilities of
the idiosyncratic error terms.1For instance, the estimated factor loads significantly on energy
uncertainty and the number of trade sanctions indicators, while it considers the FDI ratio
1Figure A-2 in the Appendix reports posterior estimates for the constants, persistence, and volatilities.

to be less important. These results are intuitive. Energy uncertainty comes directly from
the availability of energy in international markets, and trade sanctions are at the core of
the ability to trade. On the other hand, FDI might signal both more integration (e.g., a
multinational opens a factory in country A because it is part of the international added value
chain) and less integration (e.g., a multinational opens a factory in country A to supply the
local market because imports become subject to stiff trade restrictions).
3.5 Economic outcomes vs. policy implementation
Our baseline estimation exploits indicators that measure both policy (e.g., the number of
trade restrictions) and the outcomes resulting from these policies (e.g., the openness ratio).
Figure 4 establishes how our DFM (2) varies when it is estimated using either only the empiri-
cal indicators from the “metrics of economic integration” or only the “policy implementation
gauges.” Panel (A) compares the baseline case with the estimation using “metrics of eco-
nomic integration.” Panel (B) compares the baseline case with the estimation using “policy
implementation gauges.”

Notes: Estimated fragmentation index using only indicators from the “metrics of economic integration” (red
line) and “policy implementation gauges” (green line), compared to the baseline estimate (blue line).
The main lesson from Figure 4 is that all three specifications give us roughly the same
answer. In other words, as we will document in Section 3.8, our measurements are not unduly
sensitive to specific choices of indicators.
There are a few interesting differences, though. First, while most indicators under “metrics
of economic integration” are available throughout the estimation sample, those under “policy
implementation gauges” are not. This limited data availability leads to large increases in
15
estimation uncertainty in Panel (B) and an index that moves less (as extracting the signal
from noise becomes harder). Second, the sharp uptick in fragmentation in the post-COVID-
19 pandemic period primarily stems from policy changes rather than from outcome variables.
Third, this exercise suggests that the use of a single factor is enough, as the fragmentation
estimates from the two separate analyses are highly correlated with each other. Nonetheless,
the question of determining the number of factors deserves a more detailed exploration.
3.6 A two-factor model
To formally explore whether we need one or more factors to extract the relevant information
from the data, we expand the baseline specification (2) to include two factors, f1,tandf2,t,
positing that the common dynamics are driven by two distinct patterns:
yi,t=ai,t+bi,tf1,t+ci,tf2,t+ui,t,
ai,t=ai,0+ai,1t,
f1,t=ϕf1,1f1,t−1+...+ϕf1,pf1,t−p+σf1,tϵf1,t, ϵ f1,t∼ N(0,1),
f2,t=ϕf2,1f2,t−1+...+ϕf2,pf2,t−p+σf2,tϵf2,t, ϵ f2,t∼ N(0,1),
bi,t=bi,t−1+σbiϵbi,t, ϵ bi,t∼ N(0,1),
ci,t=ci,t−1+σciϵci,t, ϵ ci,t∼ N(0,1),
ui,t=ϕui,1ui,t−1+...+ϕui,qui,t−q+σui,tϵui,t, ϵ ui,t∼ N(0,1),
hj,t=hj,t−1+σhjϵhj,t, σ j,t=σjexp(hj,t), ϵ hj,t∼ N(0,1). (4)
Although expanding the specification to three or more factors is possible, our results below
will show that it does not seem necessary. Appendix B describes the estimation process.
Estimating the DFM (4) necessitates identification assumptions on bi,tandci,t. These
assumptions can be thought of as an exclusion restriction, where a subset of indicators loads
exclusively on one factor. Otherwise, we could reallocate any portion of the loadings between
the factors without affecting the overall likelihood. Furthermore, we need a normalization
that separates both factors. A simple (and economically intuitive) choice is that all variables
classified under the “metrics of economic integration” always load on the first factor.
Then, we explore all possible scenarios for how the remaining three categories of indicators
(“policy implementation gauges,” “text-mining-derived indicators,” and “policy reflections”)
can load on both factors.2If we ensure that each category loads on at least one factor and
avoid duplicates due to label-switching between the two factors, we have a total of 40 cases.
One trivial case among those 40 is when the four categories load on the first factor but none
on the second: this is just our baseline specification with only one factor.3
2The first category can load on the second factor as well if another category is excluded from it.
3In principle, we could also have restrictions on each of the components of each category, multiplying

Notes: Panel (A) compares the estimates (indicated by red lines) with those from our baseline single-factor
case, indicated by blue lines. For clarity, we label the two factors f1,tandf2,tas the 1stand 2ndfactors,
respectively. In panel (B), a value of 0 denotes an exclusion restriction applied during the estimation,
indicating that the factor loading is set to zero for the corresponding entry.
Instead of reporting the results for each of the 40 cases, we select four representative
cases described in Panel (B) of Figure 5 that are sufficient to make our point. Case ( I1)
implements the most extreme exclusion restrictions: the “metrics of economic integration”
load exclusively on the first factor, while all other indicators load only on the second factor,
ensuring no overlap between the two factors. Despite this separation, as shown in the first
column of Panel (A) of Figure 5, each factor estimate still exhibits strong comovement with
our baseline factor (depicted by the blue lines), indicating a high correlation between the two
factors, albeit with varying levels of estimation uncertainty.
In contrast, cases ( I2), (I3), and ( I4) are increasingly less restrictive, allowing some
indicators to load on both factors. For instance, ( I2) also loads category “text-mining-
exponentially the number of possible cases. Not only does this strategy seem more arbitrary than our choice
of excluding categories as a whole but, given the results below, it is unlikely to result in different findings.

derived indicators” on the first factor while ( I4) only excludes the first category “metrics of
economic integration” from the second factor (the absolute minimal exclusion we can have
to ensure identification). In these alternative cases, the second factor contributes minimally
to the model, with the majority of the comovement captured by the first factor. Notice that
these cases are similar to, but more general than, what we presented in Figure 4.
In summary, the data strongly support the assumption that a single factor is sufficient.
Therefore, we will use a single-factor model for the remainder of the paper.
3.7 Stochastic trends
Our baseline DFM specification (2) assumes that the common dynamics across empirical
indicators are captured by their stationary components, while deterministic time trends for
each indicator are modeled as orthogonal to the common factor.
Figure 6: Estimated fragmentation when the factor includes stochastic trends
1980 1990 2000 2010 2020-1-0.500.511.522.5
Notes: Estimated factor, with 90% credible intervals, under the assumption that the factor follows a random-
walk process, shown in red.
Now, we modify this assumption by allowing the common factor itself to be nonstationary,
potentially capturing stochastic common trends. We achieve this by setting ftin the DFM
(2) to be a random-walk process. This adjustment enables us to incorporate trends in both
idiosyncratic components (through deterministic processes) and common components (via
stochastic processes). As shown in Figure 6, the results are very similar to those of the
baseline case, with a correlation of 0.98 compared to those from our baseline case.
18
3.8 Alternative selection of indicators and prior choices
In our next exercise, we demonstrate the robustness of our DFM estimation results by show-
casing their consistency across alternative prior choices and selections of indicators.
Figure 7 plots the median estimate of our baseline specification plus a set of ten variations.
We ensure consistency by scaling all lines to match the standard deviation of the baseline
case. This allows for straightforward comparison across all lines. For clarity, we designate
the baseline scenario as “All series & Priors 1,” indicating our utilization of all 14 series of
indicators in Figure 1 and adherence to the prior choices outlined in (3).

Notes: Median-smoothed estimates of the fragmentation index under baseline specification and ten varia-
tions.
Now, we explain the different lines. First, we examine three distinct sets of prior selections
for the variance parameters listed below while preserving all 14 series. We focus exclusively
on adjusting priors for the variance parameters, as the priors for the remaining parameters
have already been set to sufficiently broad values.
The rationale for organizing these choices according to their importance level is as fol-
lows. First, varying options for σ2
biare critical as they dictate the degree of time variations
in the factor loading, thereby influencing our estimation outcomes. Second, the priors for
σ2
uidirectly impact the signal-to-noise ratio by determining the variance magnitude of the
unexplained idiosyncratic component, rendering them potentially significant for estimation.
Last, the priors for σ2
hfandσ2
hiregulate the extent of time variations in stochastic volatility,
19
consequently affecting the signal-to-noise ratio. Specifically, we consider:
Priors 2: σ2
bi∼ IG (10,1), σ2
ui∼ IG (10,10), σ2
hf, σ2
hi∼ IG (10,10),
Priors 3: σ2
bi∼ IG (10,0.1), σ2
ui∼ IG (1,2), σ2
hf, σ2
hi∼ IG (10,1),
Priors 4: σ2
bi∼ IG (10,0.1), σ2
ui∼ IG (1,0.5), σ2
hf, σ2
hi∼ IG (10,1).
Subsequently, having gauged the implications of alternative prior choices for estimation
outcomes, we revert to the prior choices for the baseline scenario as delineated in equation (3),
and examine variations in the set of indicators. The “Core 7” denotes the scenario wherein
we exclusively utilize trade openness, the FDI ratio, the financial flow ratio, the number of
sanctions, the geopolitical risk index, the trade policy uncertainty, and the number of con-
flicts. We call these indicators the “Core 7” owing to their quarterly frequency availability
throughout the entire estimation period from 1975 to 2022. Next, we incrementally incor-
porate (in different combinations) the number of trade restrictions (TR), the migration fear
index (MF), the energy uncertainty (EU), the capital control (CC), the UNGA kappa score
(KS), the migration flow ratio (MFs), and the patent flows (PF).
Figure 7 juxtaposes the median-smoothed estimates of the fragmentation index across
these adjustments. Remarkably, the time-series plots of our estimated fragmentation index
remain highly similar throughout these modifications. They consistently depict a robust cor-
relation, averaging approximately 0.95, with the lowest observed correlation hovering around
0.85. This compelling evidence strongly reinforces our assertion that a specific set of empir-
ical indicators does not influence the estimation but rather that it captures the underlying
dynamics of fragmentation.
4 A PCA Empirical Strategy
Our DFM is a flexible tool designed to capture a wide range of time variations, such as changes
in factor loadings or innovation variances. Nonetheless, a researcher could be concerned
that its technical requirements may obscure information that a simple alternative, such as a
principal components analysis (PCA), could more transparently document.
To check this, in this section, we rely on Hamilton and Xi (2024), who outline a PCA pro-
cedure for uncovering common cyclical factors driving a mix of stationary and non-stationary
variables. Hamilton (2018) shows that it is possible to use OLS to estimate an h-period-
ahead forecast of the level of any variable as a linear function of its own lags without
knowing the nature of the non-stationarity. We set hto 5 years and lto 2 years to esti-
mate yi,t+h=ξ0+Pl
j=1ξjyi,t−j+1+νi,t+h. Then, we conduct PCA using the forecast errors
ˆνi,t+h=yi,t+h−ˆξ0−Pl
j=1ˆξjyi,t−j+1of the “Core 7” variables following the method in Hamilton
and Xi (2024). We focus on the “Core 7” because they are available at a quarterly frequency
20

1980 1990 2000 2010 2020-1-0.500.511.522.5
Notes: The exclusion of the initial seven years ( h= 5 and l= 2) of data accounts for the missing data in the
first PCA.
while the other variables are available only annually and with different sample lengths.
We plot the first principal component in Figure 8 (green line) and compare it with our
baseline factor (blue line). The patterns of both estimates are quite similar, including the
decaying fragmentation from the mid-1990s and the increase following the 2007-2008 financial
crisis and the overall correlation between the first principal component and the baseline
estimate is approximately 0.61. The only significant difference is the drop in the first principal
component at the end of the sample, which we attribute to the limited information available
to the procedure.4Therefore, we decide to keep our DFM as our baseline specification.
5 The Causal Effects of Geopolitical Fragmentation
We can now delve into exploring the causal link between geopolitical fragmentation and global
economic activity. Our investigation employs two widely accepted empirical techniques for
causality assessment in time series: structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) and local pro-
jections (LPs). SVARs and LPs are alike in their fundamental nature, estimating dynamic
relationships among observed variables within a linear projection model class; see Plagborg-
4We also estimated the baseline model using the forecast errors, ˆ νi,t+h, by setting ai,tin (2) to zero. The
correlation between these estimates and the baseline estimates is around 0.55. One issue with the approach
` a la Hamilton (2018) is the exclusion of the initial seven years of data, which results in large and persistent
credible intervals. These intervals tend to expand toward the end of the sample, particularly encompassing
the period including the pandemic. Due to space constraints, these results are not reported here.
21
Møller and Wolf (2021). In a finite sample and under model specification uncertainty, SVARs
efficiently regulate the structure of relationships among variables. Conversely, LPs offer a
more flexible model specification framework, exhibiting resilience against the curse of dimen-
sionality. Their complementarities justify the use of both approaches to have a more complete
assessment of the causal effects of geopolitical fragmentation.
We apply SVARs and LPs to quarterly panel data, covering a comprehensive set of macro
and financial variables across a total of 61 economies: 34 advanced economies (AEs) and 27
emerging markets (EMs) with available data. Appendix E.2 provides descriptive statistics
for these variables.
We begin with a panel SVAR to scrutinize the impact of fragmentation on a country’s
macro and financial variables. Afterward, we transition to a panel LP analysis to explore
potential heterogeneity across the sample. We complete our empirical investigation with a
sectoral impact employing LPs.
5.1 Aggregate impact: A panel SVAR approach
The panel SVAR comprises 11 variables categorized into global and country components.
The global bloc encompasses (i) our geopolitical fragmentation index, (ii) the VIX, (iii) the
log of the S&P 500 index, (iv) the log of the WTI price of oil, (v) the yield on two-year U.S.
Treasuries, (vi) the Chicago Federal Reserve National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI),
and (vii) the log of world real GDP, aligning with the variable selection methodology of
Caldara and Iacoviello (2022). The global variables control for the interactions between the
fragmentation index and the aggregate variables of a country, aiding in the identification
of the causal effects of shocks to the fragmentation index. Notably, U.S. financial market
indicators are treated as “global” variables due to their influential role in the global market.
The country bloc consists of (viii) the log of a country’s stock price index (SP it), (ix) the
industrial production index (IP it), (x) the log of fixed investment (I it), and (xi) the log of per
capita GDP (GDP it).5
The SVAR incorporates two lags and utilizes quarterly data from 1986:Q1 to 2022:Q4,
with the starting point of the sample determined by the availability of the VIX. To capture
country-specific factors, the panel SVAR is estimated with country fixed effects (FEs). Data
are sourced from the IMF International Financial Statistics (IFS), and observations with
changes from the previous period in the top or bottom 1.25th percentile are excluded as
outliers. The sample, constituting an unbalanced panel, consists of 2,359 observations from 26

countries (17 AEs and 9 EMs). The sample size is smaller than in the subsequent LP analysis,
since VARs necessitate the availability of all variables simultaneously. In comparison, LPs can
be executed for each variable independently, resulting in more observations for regressions.
Standard errors are clustered by time due to the absence of cross-sectional variations in
global variables. A fragmentation shock is identified through Cholesky decomposition, with
the fragmentation index ordered first. This identification assumption relies on the hypoth-
esis that geopolitical fragmentation is driven more by low-frequency forces (e.g., changes in
international relations driven by demographics or ideological shifts) than by contemporary
quarterly shocks to aggregate economic variables.

Figure 9 presents the impulse response functions (IRFs) of country variables to a one-
standard-deviation fragmentation shock. Given the assumption of identical coefficients in
the VAR system across countries, these IRFs can be interpreted as the average effects of a
fragmentation shock within the sample. Following a positive innovation to the fragmentation
index (deemed adverse), all four country variables—GDP per capita, industrial production,
fixed investment, and stock prices—experience declines. The negative effects become most
pronounced approximately one to two years after the initial shock. The impact is substantial
and persistent, with the peak effect of a one-standard-deviation fragmentation shock resulting
in approximately a 0.3% decline in GDP.
5.2 Assessing the robustness of SVAR results
Next, we report the key findings of our robustness checks. Appendix E.3 provides more
details. Despite different prior choices or different sets of empirical indicators, the consistency
in SVAR outcomes across these variations strengthens the credibility of our findings.
23
5.2.1 Examination of estimation modifications
We assess the robustness of our results by systematically examining various estimation mod-
ifications. In addition, we investigate a scenario where trade openness serves as the sole
indicator for geopolitical fragmentation, a common practice in the literature. Our findings
reveal that adverse shocks to trade openness, indicative of increased fragmentation, indeed
exert a negative impact on economic activity. Yet, this impact is markedly transitory, endur-
ing only up to one year and displaying subsequent mean reversion (Appendix Figure A-5).
In contrast, our baseline results unveil a divergent narrative, highlighting the prolonged per-
sistence of observed effects for an extended duration, exceeding three to four years. This
suggests that our fragmentation measure presents a materially different picture, which holds
greater significance for the global economy.
5.2.2 Imposing alternative identification strategies
We assess the robustness of our SVAR results by employing two alternative identification
strategies: switching the Cholesky ordering and a narrative approach.6
First, we change the ordering of variables in the Cholesky decomposition. This approach
gauges the importance of our identification assumption. Panel (A) of Figure 10 presents the
IRFs in which the fragmentation index is ordered last in the Cholesky ordering. One can
think about this ordering as the worst-case scenario for the hypothesis that fragmentation
shocks matter. More concretely, this assumption implies that fragmentation shocks do not
have any contemporaneous impacts on global or country variables.
Not surprisingly, under this assumption, the magnitude of the IRFs diminishes, as antic-
ipated, compared to the baseline case where the fragmentation index is placed first in the
Cholesky ordering. However, most variables still indicate a significant effect of fragmentation
shocks and the shape of responses remains qualitatively unchanged. Appendix E.3 presents
the results with alternative orderings and confirms that they lie between the two scenarios
depicted in Figure 10.
Our second identification strategy employs narrative restrictions in the tradition of Mertens
and Ravn (2013). We identify significant fragmentation and globalization episodes and em-
ploy them as external instruments for fragmentation shocks. To ensure orthogonality with all
other shocks, we select episodes that are unexpected or unrelated to the state of the global
economy. Consequently, events that influenced fragmentation but were rooted in global eco-
nomic conditions or directly impacted them, such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the
6We avoid using a long-run identification strategy because there are no sharp theoretical predictions about
the long-run effects of economic fragmentation. For example, while economic theory usually predicts that
welfare (a non-observable) would be lower when there is less international trade, (measured) output might
go up or down, depending on factor endowments and their relative prices. A similar argument precludes the
use of identification strategies based on heteroskedasticity.

historical occurrences, such as the dissolution of the USSR and the U.S.-China trade war, into multiple events.
Hence, we present a total of 22 narrative episodes. Narrative episodes reflecting geopolitical fragmentation
(globalization) are marked with an asterisk (dagger). For (C), while these events were typically agreed upon or
announced beforehand, their implementation signifies material alterations in measures that impact economic

leading to a 0.7% decline in GDP per capita in response to a one-standard-deviation shock.
This outcome suggests the presence of measurement errors in the fragmentation index, which
are effectively corrected by the instruments.
Taken together, our two alternative identification strategies underscore the robustness of
our SVAR results under a reasonable set of identification assumptions.
5.3 Aggregate impact: A panel LP approach
We implement a panel LP by estimating the following equation:
yi,t+h−yi,t−1=βhst+LX
l=1αh
l∆yi,t−l+LX
l=1γh
lst−l+δhXi,t+µh
i+ϵh
i,t, (5)
forh= 0,1,2,... where yi,t+hrepresents the outcome variable in country iat time t+h,
i.e.,yi,t+h={ln(GDP it+h),IPit+h,ln(Iit+h),ln(SP it+h)}, and stis the fragmentation shock
VAR, and ztis the narrative series. Standard errors are clustered by time and shown in parentheses. The
coefficient of the narrative series is significant at the 1% level. The second stage takes steps described by
Mertens and Ravn (2013).

obtained in the SVAR. However, it is crucial to highlight the robustness of our results to
alternative identification schemes, as illustrated in Appendix E.3.5. Following Montiel Olea
and Plagborg-Møller (2021), we include lagged outcome and explanatory variables, ∆ yi,t−l
andst−l, to address serial correlation, choosing a lag length of two.
In terms of regressors, Xi,tis a vector of global and country-specific controls, encompassing
the first and second lagged terms of a country’s per capita GDP growth rate and the global
variables used in the VAR analysis, i.e., the VIX, the S&P 500 index, the WTI oil price, the
yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries, the NFCI, and world GDP. The WTI oil price and world
GDP are taken as log-difference. µh
idenotes country FEs and ϵh
i,tis an error term. Standard
errors are clustered by time, as in the SVAR.
The sequence of estimated coefficients, βhforh= 0,1,2,..., represents the IRFs. The
estimation period textends until 2019:Q4 to ensure a consistent sample across the horizon
h.We run the regression for each country variable separately. The number of observations
differs across variables depending on data availability: 5,543 for GDP per capita (34 AEs
/ 27 EMs), 4,153 for industrial production, 5,010 for fixed investment, and 2,430 for stock
prices in the longest horizon of the estimation ( h= 16).
As depicted in Panel (A) of Figure 11, a fragmentation shock exhibits adverse effects on
country variables, showing qualitative similarity to the SVAR result. Notably, the estimated
magnitude is somewhat larger in the LP analysis. For instance, the peak response of GDP
per capita is approximately 0.9%. This variance is partly attributed to the broader inclusion
of EMs in the sample.
In Panels (B)-(F) of Figure 11, we investigate state dependence across country and shock
characteristics by incorporating distinct coefficients, thus examining variations in the regres-
sion outcomes for different countries and shocks categorized as positive vs. negative:

where 1i,tis an indicator variable that takes one for the sample with a feature of interest.
In Panel (B), fragmentation negatively impacts both AEs and EMs. The adverse reper-
cussions are more pronounced for EMs. This suggests that countries with lower income levels
experience more severe consequences from fragmentation, indicating greater potential benefits
from globalization.
Transitioning to Panel (C), we classify sample countries based on their voting patterns
in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on March 2, 2022, condemning Russia’s
aggression against Ukraine. The “East” group, comprising nations like Russia, China, India,
and South Africa, which either opposed or abstained from voting on the resolution, exhibits

Notes: Percent responses to a one-standard-deviation fragmentation shock. Shaded areas and dashed lines
indicate the 90th percentiles. In Panel (A), all countries include AEs and EMs. In Panel (B), AEs and EMs
follow the classification of the IMF World Economic Outlook. In Panel (C), the term “West” encompasses
countries that supported the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on March 2, 2022 (ES-11/1), while
“West” comprises countries that either voted against the resolution or abstained. In Panel (D), countries with
trade share are defined as those with (export+import)/GDP above the median of the sample. In Panel (E),
the trade share with the U.S. is calculated using country-pair trade flows in the BACI database. In Panel (F),
a positive shock to the fragmentation index is denoted as a “fragmentation” shock, while a negative shock is
referred to as a “globalization” shock.

more substantial declines in the aftermath of a fragmentation shock. This result is interesting
as some of these nations tend to be less supportive of a rules-based international order from
which they benefit more.
In Panels (D) and (E), we explore the relationship between the impact of fragmentation
shocks and a country’s trade openness, measured by the trade share (i.e., the sum of exports
and imports relative to GDP). Panel (D) highlights that nations with higher trade shares are
more susceptible to the effects of fragmentation shocks. Conversely, a reversal is observed
when trade openness is linked to the U.S. Panel (E) shows that countries with higher trade
shares with the U.S. exhibit lower vulnerability to the impacts of fragmentation shocks.
Lastly, Panel (F) delves into disparities between positive (fragmentation) and negative
(globalization) shocks by estimating these IRFs separately in the state-dependency regression
(6). This figure illustrates that fragmentation shocks exert immediate adverse impacts on
the global economy, whereas the effects of globalization shocks unfold gradually over 2 to 3
years, demonstrating greater persistence.
5.4 Sectoral impact: A panel LP approach
5.4.1 OECD countries
So far, we have shown that fragmentation has adverse effects on the overall economy. Our
focus now shifts to examining how fragmentation influences various sectors within a country,
with a particular emphasis on OECD countries.
The OECD conducts an annual breakdown of GDP across ten major sectors, aligning
closely with the 2-digit U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system used in the
subsequent section. This GDP breakdown covers the 38 OECD member countries. Utilizing
VAR-identified fragmentation shocks and employing the set of control variables from the
preceding section, we perform a panel LP analysis of (5). The dataset, an unbalanced panel,
spans from 1986 to 2022, with most countries’ data becoming available only in the late 1990s.
Panel (A) of Figure 12 reports the responses at impact to a fragmentation shock to
sectoral GDP in OECD countries. Sectors with greater exposure to global economic and
financial activities, such as manufacturing, construction (investment activities), wholesale
and retail trade, information and communication, and professional services, demonstrate more
pronounced responses. In contrast, domestically oriented sectors like agriculture, forestry, and
fishing, real estate, and public services exhibit muted reactions. Importantly, this discernible
sectoral pattern is also observed in the case of the U.S. economy, a point we delve into in the
following section.

wholesale, retail trade, repairs, transport, accommodation, and food services. “Professional, etc.” represents
professional, scientific, and support services. “Public, etc.” is the sum of public administration, defense,

responses of 1-year-ahead GDP to a one-standard-deviation shock to the factor. Bars indicate the 90th
percentiles. Since the BEA stopped updating GDP by state before 1997, we map the previous SIC to
the current NAICS. Specifically, the SIC “communications” sector is connected to “information” under the
NAICS; the SIC “service” is the sum of “professional and business services,” “management of companies and
enterprises,” “educational service, health care, and social assistance,” and “arts, entertainment, recreation,
accommodation, and food services”; other sectors are connected to the sectors with the same labels in the
SIC and the NAICS.
5.4.2 The U.S.
Next, we explore sectoral data within the U.S. Using annual GDP data compiled by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) since 1977 (with quarterly data available from 2005:Q1
30
onward), we employ a panel LP approach outlined in equation (5) covering the period from
1986 to 2022. The control variables include U.S. aggregate GDP growth and the same global
variables utilized in the cross-country analysis. The fragmentation shocks, aggregated annu-
ally, serve as the central variable of interest.
Panel (B) of Figure 12 illustrates the responses at impact to a fragmentation shock in
U.S. sectoral GDP. Our focus is on the ten major private sectors and the government sector
at the 2-digit level of the SIC within regional GDP. The figure highlights the concentrated
adverse effects of fragmentation in specific sectors, including manufacturing, durable goods,
transportation, and wholesale, likely attributed to the heightened exposure of these sectors
to global economic activities.
6 Geopolitical Bloc Fragmentation
Is the global trend of fragmentation distributed evenly or unevenly across different regions of
the world? For instance, an extreme consequence of fragmentation would be the division of
the world into separate economic blocs, each with its own dynamics.
While the world economy has not yet fully divided into these separate blocs, we can
measure the extent to which fragmentation between and within blocs is already significant.
Does the degree of fragmentation within different geopolitical blocs affect the bloc’s aggregate
dynamics? Does fragmentation in different regions impact the global economy differently?
To answer these questions, we explore fragmentation within geopolitical blocs and examine
the potentially heterogeneous effects of each bloc’s fragmentation on the global economy.
6.1 Measuring geopolitical bloc fragmentation
We expand our baseline DFM by considering three geopolitical blocs: the U.S.-EU bloc, the
China-Russia bloc, and the Others bloc. For each bloc, we collect eight empirical indicators
reflecting geopolitical fragmentation and are chosen based on their availability: trade open-
ness, FDI ratio, financial flow ratio, trade restrictions, capital control measures, sanctions,
geopolitical risk index, and the UNGA kappa score. The data used for estimation are detailed
in Appendix D.4.
Specifically, we express equation (2) for each of these three blocs. With the exception of
the treatment of the factor, all other aspects are treated symmetrically. We utilize the same
priors as those employed in our baseline case. When considering the factor for the global bloc,
we utilize a hierarchical structure, expressing it as weighted averages of the local factors:
ft=X
j∈{U.S.-EU,CHN-RUS, Others }wjf(j)
t, (7)
31
where ftrepresents the global fragmentation factor, while f(j)
tdenotes the local fragmentation
bloc factor in bloc j. We estimate the entire specification jointly, including the weights wj.
We impose the prior wj∼ N 1
3,1
100
for the weights. Appendix C reports the details.

t.
Figure 13 displays the estimated bloc fragmentation indices. These indices share broad
patterns with the global index, including the trend toward globalization before the 2007-2008
financial crisis and fragmentation afterward. However, a closer look reveals several notable
differences across geopolitical blocs.
In the U.S.-EU bloc, a globalization trend started in the 1980s and further advanced in
the early 1990s. The timing corresponds to the era of greater trade and capital flows under
the floating exchange rate regime, particularly among advanced economies. The advance of
globalization in the early 1990s picks up at the end of the Cold War. This result is intuitive
as the U.S. and the EU were among the first economies to embrace liberalization policies in
the late 1970s and early 1980s.
The globalization of the other blocs lagged and started around the mid-1990s when trade
liberalization gained momentum in large emerging economies. The movement was under-
pinned by regional trade agreements, such as NAFTA and Mercosur, as well as global in-
stitutions, such as the WTO. Growing trade and increasing financial flows into emerging
economies reinforced the trend, but it largely reverted after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
32
The dynamics of the China-Russia bloc’s factor are affected by individual events, such as
the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 and China’s move toward a market economy, including
its participation in the WTO in 2001 and the gradual deregulation of capital flows. The pro-
nounced width of the credible interval for the China-Russia bloc fragmentation index until
the mid-1990s is a reflection of the limited availability of most empirical indicators. The dy-
namics of the Other bloc’s factor resemble those depicted in Figure 2, possibly attributable to
similarities in the empirical indicators compared to those corresponding to global indicators.
Finally, the estimated global fragmentation index closely mirrors the pattern illustrated
in Figure 2, with a correlation of around 0.87. This observation is not unexpected, given
our earlier insights from Figure 7, where the robust estimation of the global fragmentation
index remained consistent across various empirical indicators. However, there is a discernible
contrast in the smoothness of the factor. While the overarching low-frequency dynamics
align, the global index exhibits slight fluctuations due to its reliance on the U.S.-EU bloc
fragmentation index, which displays more variability. This difference results in the correlation
dipping just below 0.9.
6.2 Assessing the causal effects of geopolitical bloc fragmentation
Next, we explore the ramifications of bloc fragmentation dynamics for global and regional
economies. We employ sign restrictions to identify bloc fragmentation shocks.
Initially, we estimate a VAR model encompassing the following global and bloc variables:
Y′
t="
fU.S.-EU
t −ft, fCHN-RUS
t −ft, fOthers
t−ft, f t, VIX t,
ln(S&P t), ln(WTI t),U.S. Treasuryt,NFCI t,ln(World GDP t)#
.(8)
Here, the first three entries represent the differentials of local and global fragmentation factors.
Local fragmentation shocks are defined as those that increase (decrease) global fragmentation
and render the own bloc more (less) fragmented than other blocs. This is achieved by imposing
the following sign restrictions:

uU.S.-EU

where u(j)
tis the reduced-form residuals from the VAR and ε(j)
tis the bloc-driven fragmen-
tation shocks. The sign restrictions are imposed for four quarters after the shock and reflect
standard intuition. For example, more fragmentation between the U.S. and the EU leads to
33
larger reduced-form VAR residuals from the U.S.-EU bloc than in the world as a whole. This
reflects the fact that the joint aggregate dynamics of the U.S. and the EU are more affected
by fragmentation within their own bloc than by fragmentation in other blocs.

the 90th percentiles where standard errors are clustered by time. The horizon of sign restrictions is set to 4
quarters. The IRFs to the baseline global fragmentation shock (Cholesky decomposition) are shown in gray
as a reference.
Then, the identified local fragmentation shocks are added to the baseline panel VAR.8
Each bloc’s shock is included in the VAR separately. The local fragmentation shock is ordered
first in the Cholesky decomposition when calculating the IRFs.
Figure 14 presents the results. The U.S.-EU and Others fragmentation shocks have im-
mediate adverse effects on the global economy. In contrast, the China-Russia fragmentation
shocks initially have subtle positive impacts and persistent negative effects in later years.

The delayed impacts of the China-Russia shocks may suggest that the advance of China
into the global market increased competition and partly substituted for the presence of other
countries. Similarly, there is most likely a trade relocation in the U.S. from China to other
emerging economies following the U.S.-China trade war in 2018-19.
Appendix E.3 presents the IRFs of countries within each bloc (or all blocs) to various
fragmentation shocks. We observe that the U.S.-EU and other blocs exhibit similar responses,
aligning with those of the global economy. In contrast, the responses of the China-Russia bloc
are ambiguous, lacking clear patterns, indicating the unique dynamics of their economies.
7 Conclusions
After decades of global economic integration, recent trends point to a shift toward frag-
mentation. We offer a measure of geopolitical fragmentation, drawn from diverse empirical
indicators, to precisely assess the current state and contribute to understanding its causal
effects on the global economy. Leveraging a widely used method extended for maximum flex-
ibility, our estimated DFM with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility captures
the evolving dynamics of global fragmentation.
Our analysis, employing SVAR and LP, reveals the causal relationships between changes
in fragmentation and their impacts on the global economy. We find that heightened frag-
mentation, indicated by a positive one-standard-deviation shock to the fragmentation index,
detrimentally affects the global economy, with emerging economies disproportionately affected
compared to advanced ones. Importantly, we uncover an inherent asymmetry: while fragmen-
tation immediately impairs the global economy, the benefits of reduced fragmentation, often
associated with the positive aspects of globalization, unfold gradually over time. Addition-
ally, our examination of sectors within OECD economies highlights the adverse repercussions
of fragmentation for industries intricately connected to global markets, including manufac-
turing, construction, finance, and wholesale and retail trade.

A Estimating the DFM with One Factor
The DFM with time-varying parameters is specified as follows:
yi,t=ai,t+bi,tft+ui,t,
ai,t=ai,0+ai,1t,
ft=ϕf,1ft−1+...+ϕf,pft−p+σf,tϵf,t, ϵ f,t∼ N(0,1),

ui,t=ϕui,1ui,t−1+...+ϕui,qui,t−q+σui,tϵui,t, ϵ ui,t∼ N(0,1),
hj,t=hj,t−1+σhjϵhj,t, σ j,t=σjexp(hj,t), ϵ hj,t∼ N(0,1), (A-1)
where i∈ {1, ..., N}andj∈ {f, u 1, ..., u N}. To simplify the explanation, we gather the
parameters in (A-1) as:
a0=

The model unknowns can be categorized into three sets: Θ f={fT, ϕf, σf, hT
f, σhf}, Θb=
{bT, σb}, an Θ u={a0, a1, ϕu, σu, hT
u, σhu}.
A.1 Gibbs sampler
We use the Gibbs sampler to estimate the model unknowns. For the k-th iteration:

For ease of exposition, we omit the superscript ( k) when describing the procedure below.

A.2 Updating the factor and the associated parameters Θf
We re-express (A-1) as:
˜yi,t= ˜ai,t+˜bi,t˜ft+σui,tϵui,t,
˜yi,t= (yi,t−ϕui,1yi,t−1...−ϕui,qyi,t−q),
˜ai,t=ai,0(1−ϕui,1...−ϕui,q) +ai,1(t−ϕui,1(t−1)...−ϕui,q(t−q)),
˜bi,t=h

Based on the state-space representation in (A-4), we draw fTbased on the forward filtering
and backward smoothing algorithm explained in Appendix A.5. Conditional on the drawn
fT, we draw {ϕf, σf, hT
f, σhf}based on the procedure described in Appendix A.6.
A.3 Updating the factor loading and the associated parameters Θb
For each i∈ {1, ..., N}, we re-express (A-1) as
ˆyi,t= ˆai,t+ˆftˆbi,t+σui,tϵui,t,
ˆyi,t= (yi,t−ϕui,1yi,t−1...−ϕui,qyi,t−q),

Based on the state-space representation in (A-5), we draw bT
ibased on the forward filtering
and backward smoothing algorithm explained in Appendix A.5. Conditional on the drawn
bT
i, we draw σbibased on the procedure described in Appendix A.6.
A.4 Updating the remaining parameters: Θu
First, conditional on {ϕu, σu, hT
u}, we re-express (A-1) as:
¯yi,t=ai¯xi,t+σuiϵui,t, (A-6)
where:
¯yi,t=ˆyi,t−ˆftˆbi,t
exp(hui,t),¯xi,t=h
1−ϕui,1...−ϕui,q
exp(hui,t),t−ϕui,1(t−1)...−ϕui,q(t−q)
exp(hui,t)i
,
and ˆyi,t,ˆft, and ˆbi,tare provided in (A-5). We draw aibased on the procedure described in
Appendix A.6. Second, conditional on the updated a, we re-express (A-1) as
ui,t=yi,t−ai,t−bi,tft (A-7)
and update the associated parameters and stochastic volatilities {ϕu, σu, hT
u, σhu}of the seri-
ally correlated errors based on the procedure described in Appendix A.6.
A.5 Forward filtering and backward smoothing algorithm
To illustrate the forward filtering and backward smoothing algorithm by Carter and Kohn
(1994), we will use a generic expression for the state-space model:
ot=A+Ztst+ηt, η t∼ N(0,Ωt),
st= Φst−1+εt, ε t∼ N(0,Σt).
We summarize the Kalman filter as described in Durbin and Koopman (2001). Suppose that
st−1|yt−1∼ N(st−1|t−1, Pt−1|t−1). Then, the Kalman forecasting and updating equations are:
st|t−1= Φst−1|t−1
Pt|t−1= ΦPt−1|t−1Φ′+ Σ t
st|t=st|t−1+ (ZtPt|t−1)′(ZtPt|t−1Z′
t)−1 
ot−A−Ztst|t−1
Pt|t=Pt|t−1−(ZtPt|t−1)′(ZtPt|t−1Z′
t)−1(ZtPt|t−1).
In turn, st|ot∼ N(st|t, Pt|t).
A-3
The backward smoothing algorithm developed by Carter and Kohn (1994) is applied to
generate draws from the distributions sτrecursively |sτ+1, ..., s T, oT(ignoring dependency on
model unknowns) for τ=T−1, T−2, . . . , 1. The last elements of the Kalman filter recursion
provide the initialization for the simulation smoother:
sτ|τ+1=sτ|τ+Pτ|τΦ′P−1
τ+1|t 
sτ+1−Φsτ|τ
Pτ|τ+1=Pτ|τ−Pτ|τΦ′P−1
τ+1|τΦPτ|τ
draw sτ∼N(sτ|τ+1, Pτ|τ+1), τ =T−1, T−2, ...,1.
A.6 Drawing persistence, variance, and stochastic volatility of the
autoregressive model
To illustrate the procedure, we will use a generic expression for the autoregressive model. To
simplify, we assume an AR(1) model with stochastic volatility as described in (A-8)
xt=ρxxt−1+σxexp(ht)ϵx,t, ϵ x,t∼ N(0,1). (A-8)
Drawing ρx.In order to obtain the posterior for ρx, we assume that for t≤0,ht= 0. Under
this assumption, x0is generated from a stationary distribution. Express the unconditional
distribution as
x0∼ N(0,Σx0),
where Σ x0=1
(1−ρ2x). From (A-8), we get var(x1) = ρ2
xvar(x0) + exp(2 h1) = Sx0, where
Sx0=ρ2
xΣx0+ exp(2 h1).
We write the conditional likelihood of the first factor element as:
L(x1|h1, ρx) =1√2πSx0exp
−1
2Sx0x2
1
, (A-9)
and the remaining T−1 elements as:
L(x2, ..., x T|h1:T, ρx) =TY
t=21p
2πexp(2 ht)exp
−1
2(xt−ρxxt−1
exp(ht))′(xt−ρxxt−1
exp(ht))
∝exp1
2(e0−E0ρx)′(e0−E0ρx)
(A-10)
where:
e0=
x2

exp(hT)
, E 0=
x1
exp(h2)...
xT−1
exp(hT)
.
A-4
We use ρx∼ N(V−1
ρx(¯Vρx¯ρx+E′
0e0), V−1
ρx) as a proposal distribution, where Vρx=¯Vρx+E′
0E0.
In a Metropolis-Hastings step, we accept the draw ρxgenerated from the proposal distribution
with probability
min(
L(x1|h1, ρ(k)
x)
L(x1|h1, ρ(k−1)
x),1)
.
Drawing σ2
x.The posterior for σ2
xis given by:
σ2
x∼ IG¯T+T
2,¯v+ (e0−E0ρx)′(e0−E0ρx)
.
Drawing hT.The last step of the Gibbs sampler draws the stochastic volatilities conditional
on all other parameters. Define γtsuch that:
γt=xt−ρxxt−1
σx
= exp( ht)ϵx,t.
Taking squares and then logs of ztproduces,
z∗
t= 2ht+u∗
t (A-11)
ht=ρhht−1+σhεt. (A-12)
where z∗
t= ln( γ2
t+ 0.001) and u∗
t= ln( ϵ2
x,t).Observe that εtandu∗
tare not correlated.
The resulting state-space representation is linear but not Gaussian since the measurement
error u∗
tis distributed as a ln( χ2
1).We approximate ln( χ2
1) using a mixture of normals and
transform the system into a Gaussian one following Kim et al. (1998). Express the distribution
ofu∗
tas:
f(u∗
t) =KX
k=1qkfN(u∗
t|ιt=k),
where ιtis the indicator variable selecting which member of the mixture of normals has
to be used at time t. The function fN(·) denotes the pdf of a normal distribution, and
qk= Pr( ιt=k). Kim et al. (1998) select a mixture of seven normals ( K= 7) with component
probabilities qk, means mk−1.2704, and variances r2
k.
Conditional on ι1:T, the system has an approximate linear and Gaussian state-space form
to which the standard Kalman filtering algorithm and the backward recursion of Carter and
Kohn (1994) can be applied. Drawing hTis, then, straightforward. The parameters associated

B Estimating the DFM with Two Factors
The DFM with time-varying parameters is specified as follows:
yi,t=ai,t+bi,tf1,t+ci,tf2,t+ui,t,
ai,t=ai,0+ai,1t,
f1,t=ϕf1,1f1,t−1+...+ϕf1,pf1,t−p+σf1,tϵf1,t, ϵ f1,t∼ N(0,1),
f2,t=ϕf2,1f2,t−1+...+ϕf2,pf2,t−p+σf2,tϵf2,t, ϵ f2,t∼ N(0,1),

hj,t=hj,t−1+σhjϵhj,t, σ j,t=σjexp(hj,t), ϵ hj,t∼ N(0,1), (A-13)
A-6
where i∈ {1, ..., N}andj∈ {f1, f2, u1, ..., u N}. To simplify the explanation, we gather the
parameters in (A-13) as:

The model unknowns can be categorized into three sets:
Θf={fT
1, ϕf1, σf1, hT
f1, σhf1, fT
2, ϕf2, σf2, hT
f2, σhf2},Θb={bT, σb, cT, σc},
Θu={a0, a1, ϕu, σu, hT
u, σhu}.
B.1 Gibbs sampler
We use the Gibbs sampler to estimate the model unknowns. For the k-th iteration:
(G1) Appendix B.2: Run Kalman filter and smoother using the algorithm to update Θ(k)
f
conditional on Θ(k−1)
f,Θ(k−1)
b,Θ(k−1)
u.
(G2) Appendix B.3: Run Kalman filter and smoother using the algorithm to update Θ(k)
b

(G3) Appendix B.4: Update the remaining parameters, including ones associated with the
serially correlated innovation Θ(k)
uconditional on Θ(k)
f,Θ(k)

u.
For ease of exposition, we omit the superscript ( k) when describing the procedure below.

Variables without the superscript jsignify that they are generated globally or derived from
cross-bloc averages.

C.1 Modified Gibbs sampler

D Data
D.1 Geopolitical fragmentation indicators
Descriptions and data sources are found below.
1.The trade openness ratio
Description. The trade openness ratio is defined as the sum of exports and imports
of goods and services divided by nominal GDP. The global indicator is constructed
as the sum of all countries’ exports and imports divided by world nominal GDP in
current U.S. $. The definition is isomorphic to a country’s trade openness weighted by
the nominal GDP share. The bloc indicators are calculated accordingly for a group of
countries in each bloc.
Frequency. Quarterly.
Sources. Exports and imports are obtained from the balance of payment (BoP) statistics
in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). GDP is also taken from the IFS, and
missing values are imputed by the linear interpolation of the annual GDP series in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO) Database. Since Chinese trade data have a limited
period (since 2005:Q1) in the IFS, they are imputed by trade partners’ exports and
imports available in the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics.
2.The FDI ratio
Description. The foreign direct investment (FDI) ratio is the sum of FDI inflows and
outflows in the BoP statistics divided by nominal GDP. The global and bloc indicators
are constructed in the same way as the trade openness ratio.
Frequency. Quarterly.
Sources. The IFS and WEO database. The same as the trade openness ratio.
3.The financial flow ratio
Description. The financial flow ratio is calculated as the sum of inflows and outflows
associated with portfolio investment and other investments in the BoP statistics as a
share of nominal GDP. The global indicator and bloc indicators are constructed in the
same way as the trade openness ratio.
Frequency. Quarterly.
Sources. The IFS and WEO database. The same as the trade openness ratio.
4.The migration flow ratio
Description. Migration flows are defined as the absolute number of net migration
flows in each country as a share of the population. The global and bloc indicators are
calculated as the weighted average of a respective group of countries using population
weights.
A-13
Frequency. Annual.
Sources. Data are obtained from the World Population Prospects 2022 by the United
Nations.
5.The patent flows
Description. Cross-border patents are those filed in one country by a resident of another.
Patent data are from International Patent and Citations across Sectors (INPACT-S)
compiled by LaBelle et al. (2023). The database is based on PATSTAT Global Autumn
2021—a commonly used patent dataset—but LaBelle et al. (2023) impute missing data
using available information and recover a large number of observations. The global and
bloc indicators are calculated as the sum of a respective group of countries.
Frequency. Annual.
Sources. Data are obtained from INPACT-S compiled by LaBelle et al. (2023).
6.The number of trade restrictions
Description. The Global Trade Alert (GTA) compiles a government statement that
includes a credible announcement of a meaningful and unilateral change in the relative
treatment of foreign vs. domestic commercial interests. The foreign commercial inter-
ests considered by the GTA are trade in goods and services, investment, and labor force
migration. All documented changes reflect unilateral government action and thus ex-
clude changes coordinated within bilateral trade agreements or the multilateral trading
system. We count the number of announcements made (with equal weights), since the
information regarding the magnitude of their economic impacts is not available. Bloc
indicators are the sum of the announcements made by countries in each bloc.
Frequency. Monthly data are converted to quarterly series.
Source. Data are obtained from the Global Trade Alert.
7.The capital control measure
Description. We follow Fern´ andez et al. (2016) for the definition of capital control mea-
sures. The IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions
(AREAER) reports the presence of rules and regulations for international transactions
by asset categories for each country. Fern´ andez et al. (2016) use the narrative de-
scription in the AREAER to determine whether there are restrictions on international
transactions, with 1 representing the presence of a restriction and 0 representing no
restriction according to several rules. For instance, if the narrative of control involves
“authorization,” “approval,” “permission,” or “clearance,” from a public institution, the
control is deemed to be in place, while it is not if a requirement is “reporting,” “reg-
istration,” or “notification.” A quantity restriction on investment (e.g., “ceiling”) is
regarded as a control. Also, if restrictions are imposed on sectors that are not deemed
to have a macroeconomic effect or are associated with a particular country or small
A-14
group of countries for non-macroeconomic reasons, they are not categorized as capital
controls. They construct 1 or 0 indicators in each country for inflows and outflows of
10 asset categories (equity, bonds, money market instruments, collective investment,
financial credits, foreign direct investment, derivatives, commercial credits, financial
guarantees, and real estate). Then, a country indicator is calculated as the average of
the 20 sub-indicators. The global and bloc indicators are calculated as the weighted
average of a respective group of countries using PPP GDP weights. It is worth noticing
that the index does not take into consideration controls related to sanctions or national
security reasons.

8.The number of sanctions
Description. The number of sanctions is taken from the Global Sanctions Data Base
(GSDB) constructed by Felbermayr et al. (2020). The GSDB defines sanctions as
binding restrictive measures applied by individual nations, country groups, the United
Nations (UN), and other international organizations to address different types of vio-
lations of international norms by inducing target countries to change their behavior or
to constrain their actions. The database focuses on effective sanctions while exclud-
ing threats. The GSDB classifies sanctions by type into five categories covering trade
(e.g., export/import ban), financial activity (e.g., freezing a bank account), arms (e.g.,
restrictions on arms sales), military assistance (e.g., prohibiting monetary or personal
assistance), and travel (e.g., travel ban), plus a residual category collecting other sanc-
tions. If a sanction spans multiple categories, it is regarded as one action. The database
version 3, published in June 2023, includes 1,325 sanctions that were enforced over the
1949-2023 period. The global indicator is the total number of sanctions in place at
each time point. The bloc indicators are the sum of those imposed by countries in the
bloc or imposed on them. When a sanction is implemented by a group of countries
or an international organization, it is counted in a bloc if at least one country joins
the sanction. For instance, a sanction imposed by the UN is counted in each of the
U.S.-EU, CHN-RUS, and Others blocs.
Frequency. Annual.

9.The geopolitical risk index
Description. The geopolitical risk (GPR) index provides a news-based measure of ad-
verse geopolitical events and associated risks. It is constructed by counting the number
of articles related to adverse geopolitical events in each newspaper each month as a share
A-15
of the total number of news articles. The search is organized into eight categories: War
Threats, Peace Threats, Military Buildups, Nuclear Threats, Terror Threats, Beginning
of War, Escalation of War, and Terror Acts. We use the historical index, which started
in 1900 and is based on three major newspapers in the U.S.: the Chicago Tribune, the
New York Times, and the Washington Post. The bloc indicators are the weighted aver-
age of country-specific indices for each bloc with PPP GDP weights. Country-specific
indices are constructed by counting the monthly share of all newspaper articles that
both (1) meet the criteria for inclusion in the GPR index and (2) mention the name
of the country or its major cities. They are available for 44 different advanced and
emerging countries. The resulting indices capture the U.S. perspective on risks posed
by, or involving, the country in question.
Frequency. Monthly data are converted to quarterly series.

PPP GDP is obtained from the WEO Database.
10.The trade policy uncertainty
Description. The trade policy uncertainty (TPU) index is based on the frequency
of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty terms across major newspapers.1
It covers seven newspapers: Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, Guardian, Los Angeles
Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. The index is
calculated by counting the monthly frequency of articles discussing trade policy uncer-
tainty (as a share of the total number of news articles) for each newspaper. The index
is then normalized to 0 for a 1% article share. No country-specific or bloc indicators
are available.
Frequency. Monthly data are converted to quarterly series.
Source. Caldara et al. (2020). The extended series is available on the website.
11.The energy-related uncertainty index
Description. The energy-related uncertainty index (EUI) is constructed by text analysis
of the monthly country report of the Economist Intelligence Unit for 28 developed and
developing countries. An economic uncertainty index is constructed for each country
following the approach in the World Uncertainty Index by Ahir et al. (2022), i.e., by
counting the frequency of terms such as “uncertainty” as a share of total words in the
same report. Then, the same approach is taken to calculate an energy-related index
from the same source by focusing on keywords, including “energy,” “oil,” “OPEC,” and
“climate change.” A global index is a simple average of countries’ indices or weighted
by GDP. We use the GDP-weighted index. As country-specific series are not published,
1Caldara et al. (2020) constructed indicators from 3 sources: newspaper coverage, firms’ earnings calls,
and tariff rates. We use the one based on newspaper coverage, which was updated in recent months.
A-16
we cannot create bloc indices.
Frequency. Monthly data are converted to quarterly series.
Source. Dang et al. (2023). The series is downloaded from the website.
12.The migration fear index
Description. The migration fear index is constructed by counting the number of news-
paper articles with at least one term related to migration (e.g., “border control”) and
fear (e.g., “fear,” “concern”), and then dividing by the total count of newspaper arti-
cles. The index is available for four countries: the UK, Germany, France, and the U.S.
The global index is a simple average of these countries’ standardized indices.
Frequency. Monthly data are converted to quarterly series.
Source. Bloom et al. (2015). The series is downloaded from the website.
13.The number of international conflicts
Description. In the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) database, armed conflicts
are incidences of the use of armed force by an organized actor against another organized
actor or against civilians that result in at least one direct death. International conflicts
are defined as armed conflicts across states or internationalized intra-state conflicts. As
the UCDP database records the start and end of each conflict, we calculate the global
indicator by counting the number of international conflicts in place each month. Bloc
indicators are not constructed because the incidences of conflicts are concentrated in
the Others bloc and the U.S.-EU and the China-Russia blocs do not show meaningful
dynamics.
Frequency. Monthly data are converted to quarterly series.
Source. The data are taken from the UCDP Onset Dataset version 23.1 available on
the website.
14.The UN General Assembly Kappa Score
Description. The measure represents similarities in voting patterns in the United Na-
tions General Assembly. Compared to a simple measure of the sum of the squared
actual deviation between their votes (scaled by the sum of the squared maximum pos-
sible deviations between their votes), the kappa score corrects the observed variability
of the countries’ bilateral voting outcomes with the variability of each country’s voting
outcomes around its own average outcome and the difference between the two countries’
average outcomes. The global indicator is the simple average of all country pairs. Bloc
indicators are calculated as the simple average score of each bloc’s countries.
Frequency. Annual.
Source. The data are downloaded from the database built by H¨ age (2017).

started an aerial bombing campaign. The attack followed
the no response by Iraq to the UNSC Resolution 678,
adopted on November 29, 1990, and due by January 15,
1991, that required Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.1
6 1991:Q3USSR 1991 August
coupDuring August 19-22, 1991, top military and civilian
officials of the USSR attempted a coup to seize control of
the country from Mikhail Gorbachev. Though the coup
failed, it reduced the power of Gorbachev’s regime and
accelerated the resolution of the USSR.-1
7 1991:Q4Dissolution of the
USSROn December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk,
and Stanislav Shushkevich—the leaders of Russia,
Ukraine, and Belarus—signed the Belovezha Accords,
which declared that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist
and established the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS).-1
8 1994:Q1NAFTA
implementationOn January 1, 1994, the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) came into force among the U.S.,

15 2010:Q4 Arab SpringProtests in Tunisia escalated after the self-immolation of
Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi on December 17, 2010,
which led to a democratization in Tunisia (Jasmine
Revolution) and spread across the Arab world (Arab
Spring).1
16 2014:Q3 U.S. attack on ISILOn August 8, 2014, the U.S. began airstrikes against the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq. This
followed the declaration by the group to rename itself as
an Islamic State and a worldwide caliphate on June 29,
2014.1
17 2016:Q2 Brexit voteOn June 23, 2016, the “Brexit” referendum, which asked
the electorate whether the country should remain a
member of, or leave, the European Union (EU), took
place in the UK. The referendum resulted in favor of
leaving the EU, triggering the process of the country’s
withdrawal from the EU (Brexit).1
18 2017:Q4 Breakup of ISILOn October 17, 2017, the Syrian Democratic Forces
announced the full capture of Raqqa in Syria, the de
facto capital city of ISIL. In December 2017, it was
reported that ISIL had lost all strategic territory in Iraq.-1
19 2018:Q3U.S.-China trade
war (phases 1-3)On July 6, 2018, U.S. tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese
goods (announced on June 16) came into effect (phase 1).
On August 23, tariffs of 25% on additional Chinese
products worth $16 billion (announced on August 8)
became effective (phase 2). On September 24, a 10%
tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods began
(announced on September 17) (phase 3).1

D.4 Country classification and indicators for local indices
We consider three geopolitical blocs: the U.S. and EU countries bloc (U.S.-EU), China and
Russia bloc (CHN-RUS), and the remaining countries bloc (Others). EU countries are the
member states of the European Union each period. The union republics of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) are included in the CHN-RUS bloc before its dissolution
in 1991Q4. Table A-6 lists the countries and Figure A-1 presents the fragmentation indicators
for individual blocs.

Notes: Sample of AEs and EMs. Percent responses to a one-standard-deviation shock to the factor. Shaded
areas indicate the 90th percentile. In Panel (A), the first difference of the factor is used as a shock. In Panel
(B), a global VAR with the first seven variables of the baseline panel VAR is run with the sample period of
1986:Q2 to 2022Q4, and the fragmentation shock is identified through the Cholesky decomposition.

Notes: Percent responses to a one-standard-deviation shock. Shaded areas indicate the 90th percentiles
where standard errors are clustered by time. The first columns correspond to the baseline analysis in which
all countries are included in a panel VAR. In Panel (A), the horizon of sign restrictions is set to 4 quarters.
