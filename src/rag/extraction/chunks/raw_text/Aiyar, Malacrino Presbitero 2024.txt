Firms and policy makers are increasingly looking at friend-shoring to make supply chains less
vulnerable to geopolitical tensions. We test whether these considerations are shaping FDI flows,
using investment-level data on over 300,000 instances of greenfield FDI between 2003 and
2022. Estimates from a gravity model, which controls for standard push and pull factors, show
an economically significant role for geopolitical alignment in driving the geographical footprint
of bilateral investments. This result is robust to the inclusion of standard bilateral drivers of
FDI – such as geographic distance and trade flows – and the strength of the effect has increased
since 2018, with the resurgence of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Moreover, our
results are not limited to greenfield FDI, but hold also for M&As.
1. Introduction
Rising geopolitical tensions, and the uneven distribution of past gains from globalization, have contributed to increasing
skepticism towards multilateralism and to the growing appeal of inward-looking policies ( Colantone and Stanig , 2018 ; Rodrik ,
2018 ; Autor et al. , 2020 ; Pastor and Veronesi , 2021 ; Aiyar et al. , 2023a ). Brexit, the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine all pose a challenge to international relations and could herald a reversal of global economic integration.
A slowdown in globalization – often referred to as ‘‘slowbalization’’ – is not new and, for most countries, dates to the aftermath of
the global financial crisis ( Antràs , 2020 ; Baldwin , 2022 ). Within this slowdown, a fall in foreign direct investment (FDI) has been
particularly visible, with global FDI declining from 3.3 percent of GDP in the 2000s to 1.3 percent over the last 5 years, according
to the IMF World Economic Outlook dataset. While many factors contributed to this protracted phase of slowbalization, including
increasing automation and technological change ( Alonso et al. , 2022 ), the fragmentation of capital flows along geopolitical fault
lines and the potential emergence of regional blocs are novel elements.
Building on this backdrop, in this paper we ask to what extent geopolitical alignment between countries plays a role in the
allocation of FDI. To further understand if recent rising geopolitical tensions are driving the geographical footprint of global FDI,
we ask whether the role of geopolitical alignment is more relevant for strategic sectors, and if it has become more salient in recent
years. To address these questions, we use comprehensive project-level data on bilateral foreign direct investments covering the past
two decades. Our results are based on event studies around specific shifts in geopolitical alignments, non-parametric evidence, and
a full-fledged gravity model.

Prior to delving into the details of our data and analysis, it is worth noting that the increasing importance of geopolitics for the
global economy is suggested by a number of narratives that are aquiring importance among economic and political actors. Firms
and policy makers are increasingly looking at friend-shoring, nearshoring and reshoring as strategies to move production processes
to trusted countries with aligned political preferences, to make supply chains more resilient and less vulnerable to geopolitical
tensions. Recently, the U.S. Treasury Secretary argued that, rather than being highly reliant on countries with which the U.S. has
geopolitical frictions, firms should move towards the friend-shoring of supply chains to a large number of trusted countries. In
Europe, the French government has been urging the EU to accelerate production targets, weaken state aid rules, and develop a
‘‘Made in Europe’’ strategy to counter domestic production subsidies provided by the recent U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In
China, too, government directives aim to replace imported technology with local alternatives to reduce its dependence on geopolitical
rivals.
The intent of ‘‘investing in friends’’ (friend-shoring) goes beyond mere announcements and translates into policies. Recent
large-scale policies implemented by major countries to strengthen strategic domestic manufacturing sectors suggest that a shift
in cross-border capital flows is being incentivized. Most notable is a series of recent bills in the U.S. – such as the CHIPS and Science
Act and the IRA – and in Europe – such as the European Chips Act – that aim to alter the fundamentals of multinational enterprises’
production and sourcing strategies, thereby inducing a reconfiguration of supply chain networks. The rising interest in friend-shoring
is a significant reversal of the traditional division of production pursued through offshoring, driven predominantly by international
cost differentials in labor and input costs (Feenstra, 1998; Antràs and Yeaple, 2014).
In this context, such reversals are likely to have a different impact on host countries depending on the features of the investment
they receive. For instance, if an investment originates in a geopolitically distant country, or takes place in a sector considered
strategic, it is more likely to be reshored in the context of heightened geopolitical tensions. These are some of the hypotheses we
investigate to answer our research questions. To do so, as discussed in Section 2, we combine two main sources of data. First, project-
level data on almost 300,000 instances of greenfield – i.e. excluding mergers and acquisitions (M&As) – foreign direct investment
between 2003 and 2022. Second, we use voting patterns at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to measure geopolitical
alignment and capture similarity in geopolitical preferences across country pairs. The bilateral structure of the data on FDI and
geopolitical alignment allows us to estimate a standard gravity model, which absorbs push and pull factors with time-varying source
and host country fixed effects.
Our results – presented in Section 3 – show that an increase in geopolitical distance is associated with a significant and
economically meaningful decline in FDI. This result in not limited to greenfield FDI, but holds also for brownfield FDI (M&As).
The role of geopolitical distance is particularly relevant for investment in strategic sectors and for FDI in low- and middle-income
countries, for which results are robust to the inclusion of country-pair fixed effects which can control for all unobservable bilateral
factors driving cross-country investment flows. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of standard bilateral drivers of greenfield
FDI – such as geographic distance and trade flows – and has increased since 2018, with the resurgence of trade tensions between
the U.S. and China (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal, 2022).
The paper connects to various strands of the literature. First, we contribute to a recent and growing literature on geoeco-
nomics. Clayton et al. (2023) develop a framework in which a hegemon country can use a variety of channels – including trade
restrictions – to exert its power on firms and other governments, by asking them to take costly actions that benefit the hegemon. Aiyar
et al. (2023b) provide an overview of recent work showing how geoeconomic fragmentation can shape global trade, investment and
financial flows. In particular, this literature shows that the recent increase in trade and geopolitical tensions and concerns about
national security are leading to significant realignment of global value chains, investment and trade linkages (Alfaro and Chor, 2023;
Freund et al., 2023; Goldberg and Reed, 2023).
Second, the literature on the drivers of FDI has stressed the role played by geography, as well as common historical and
cultural traits, such as a shared language, institutions, and colonial relationships (see Blonigen, 2005; Blonigen and Piger, 2014;
Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2017, for a review). Empirical studies have either focused on specific source and destination countries or,
when looking at large samples, have used bilateral data published by UNCTAD for shorter or earlier periods (see, for instance, Daude
and Stein, 2007; Aleksynska and Havrylchyk, 2013; Kox and Rojas-Romagosa, 2020). We contribute to that literature by showing
– in a large sample of about 180 countries spanning the last 20 years – that FDI flows are driven not just by geographical, cultural
and institutional proximity between the host and source countries, but also by the geopolitical alignment between them.
In addition, some studies have suggested that better diplomatic and political relations are associated with larger direct investment
flows across countries. However, these studies are either based on specific source countries – like the U.S. (Desbordes, 2010) or
China (Li et al., 2018) – or on a relatively small set of source and host countries (Desbordes and Vicard, 2009; Bertrand et al.,
2016), or focus squarely on political risk (Busse and Hefeker, 2007). Contrary to this body of evidence, Damioli and Gregori (2022)
look at M&A activity within Europe and find that cross-border acquisitions of European companies are more likely when the source
and the destination countries are more geopolitically distant. We contribute to this literature by providing a comprehensive analysis
of the role of geopolitical distance on FDI flows across a large sample of advanced and developing countries over the last 20 years,
a period during which geopolitical tensions moved in both directions. In addition, the availability of investment-level data allows
us to look at important aspects of heterogeneity, such as the sectoral dimension.
Finally, an extensive literature shows that geopolitical alignment with the major Western countries (for example the U.S. by itself,
or the G7) matters for the allocation of bilateral aid (Alesina and Dollar, 2000; Faye and Niehaus, 2012), as well as for multilateral
lending (Barro and Lee, 2005; Kilby, 2009; Vreeland and Dreher, 2014). We extend this literature by showing that geopolitical
alignment is not only associated with larger aid flows, but also with more FDI. In this respect, our analysis is related to a number
of contributions showing that ideological alignment with foreign governments affects cross-border trade (Fuchs and Klann, 2013;
Davis et al., 2019; Fisman et al., 2022; Jakubik and Ruta, 2023) and capital flows (Gupta and Yu, 2007; Knill et al., 2012; Kempf
et al., 2021; Lugo and Montone, 2022).

2. Data
Our main analysis relies on proprietary data on bilateral greenfield foreign direct investment from fDi Markets, a service from
the Financial Times which tracks new physical projects and expansions of existing investments that create new jobs and capital
investment.1The data are collected primarily from publicly available sources (e.g., media sources, industry organizations, investment
promotion agency newswires) and report investment-level information for over 300,000 FDI instances between January 2003 and
December 2022 between 186 countries. For each investment, we know the source and destination countries, as well as the sector,
activity (e.g., business services, sales, R&D), type (new investment or expansion), volume (in USD) and number of jobs created.
The volume of capital investment and associated jobs are often estimated rather than based on directly reported data. The
reliability of these data is tested by aggregating the volumes at the destination country-year level and contrasting them with gross
FDI inflows as published in the World Economic Outlook dataset. Fig. A.1 shows that the two distributions have a large degree of
overlap (Panel a) and the correlation coefficient between the FDI flows obtained from the two sets of data is 0.54 (Panel b). This
is consistent with Toews and Vézina (2022), using a smaller sample. In addition, the count and volume of bilateral investment are
also tightly correlated (Panel c), supporting the choice of using the count data in our analysis. Both variables, once aggregated at
the source–destination-year level, are top-winsorised with a threshold corresponding to the 0.1 percent of the observations.
As data on mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are not available from the same data source, our main analysis is based on greenfield
investment.2However, we also use cross-border M&A data from Refinitiv Eikon to complement the baseline analysis of greenfield
FDI.3
We combine data on earnings calls from NL Analytics (Hassan et al., 2019) and a study from the Atlantic Council to define
strategic sectors at the 3-digit industry level, based on the following steps. First, we rely on a list proposed by the Atlantic Council
to identify as strategic these sectors: semiconductors, telecommunications and 5G infrastructure, equipment needed for the green
transition, pharmaceutical ingredients, and strategic and critical minerals. These sectors are mapped into the 3-digit industry
classification based on ISIC Revision 4. Second, among the manufacturing and mining sectors, the 3-digit industry groups which fall
in the top-3 deciles of mentions of reshoring-related terms in companies’ earnings calls between 2017–2022 are added to the list.
The data on earning calls are obtained through NL Analytics and we simply compute a measure of exposure counting the share of
sentences mentioning reshoring, nearshoring or friendshoring (with or without the hyphen ‘‘-’’) over the total number of sentences
in the earnings call (see Hassan et al., 2019, for more details on the data and the text mining approach). The manufacture of textiles,
which also falls in the top-3 deciles of reshoring terms mentions, is excluded.
Our measure of geopolitical distance is based on voting patterns in at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In particular,
we follow Bailey et al. (2017) and use the ideal point distance (IPD).4Some recent studies of geoeconomic fragmentation focus on
specific recent important votes, such as the March 2022 UNGA vote on resolution ES-11/1 on ‘‘Aggression against Ukraine’’ (Javorcik
et al., 2022). However, since our analysis looks at the role of geopolitical alignment over the last 20 years, we need a measure that is
available and comparable over a long period of time. The IPD has these characteristics given that it is estimated in a way that keeps
‘‘constant’’ the agenda of the UNGA, so that differences in alignments over time are not driven by changes in the topics discussed
at the UN, but by genuine shifts in geopolitical preferences between country pairs. While the IPD is widely used in political science
and in economics, scholars have also proposed alternative measures. The findings of this paper are robust to the use of the 𝑆score
or the𝑃𝑖(𝜋) measures, based on military alliances and proposed by Signorino and Ritter (1999) and Häge (2011), respectively.
Data on standard gravity variables including geographical distance, common language, legal framework and colonial ties are
taken from the CEPII gravity dataset (Conte et al., 2022). Additional macroeconomic data are taken from standard sources and they
are discussed when introducing the variables.
Given that tax havens are major recipients of direct investment from high-income countries (Hines, 2010), we exclude FDI from
and to offshore financial centers and tax havens – as defined by Damgaard et al. (2019) – to mitigate the possibility that our
findings are affected by phantom FDI (results are robust to their inclusion). The final sample consists of 157 source countries and
176 destination countries for which we have complete data and at least one FDI sourced or received is reported.
1fDi Markets does not track mergers and acquisitions and other international equity investments, investment projects that do not create new jobs, or companies
which establish a foreign subsidiary without a physical company presence.
2New (greenfield) investments are more numerous than M&As, especially in emerging and developing economies, are more strongly correlated with aggregate
data on FDI, and are less frequently concentrated in tax havens.
3The Refinitiv Eikon database has superseded the SDC Platinum database by Thomson Reuters, which has been studied extensively in recent academic
research such as Erel et al. (2022) and Bergant et al. (2023). This dataset also serves as underlying data for cross-border M&As reported in the World Investment
Report by UNCTAD.
4The measure is built by first estimating an ordered logit over three voting choices (yea, abstain, nay), where the choice depends on the parameters of the
model combined with a latent vote-specific preference of each country in a given year. The latent process is estimated by imposing a Bayesian prior on the
preferences and employing a Metropolis–Hastings/Gibbs sampler algorithm to infer the parameters of the logit model and then the posterior distribution of the
latent preference parameters. The distance between two countries in each year is then computed as the absolute value of the difference between the inferred
vote specific preference parameter. More details on the measurement and the estimation are provided in Bailey et al. (2017). The IPD data up to 2021 are
available from this link: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/Voeten.

Notes: The charts plots the number of greenfield FDI in each quarter from countries which approved the UNGA resolution to countries which either voted against
or abstained. The series are normalized to 100 in the quarter of the vote. Panel A refers to the resolution 68/262 (March 2014) about the territorial integrity
of Ukraine. Panel B refers to the resolution 72/191 (December 2017) on human rights in Syria.
3. Geopolitical distance and FDI flows
3.1. Event studies
We first offer suggestive evidence on the role of geopolitical distance from two recent important UN resolutions. Resolution 68/
262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine was adopted on 27 March 2014 in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. The
resolution recognizes the territorial integrity of Ukraine and underscores the invalidity of the 2014 Crimean referendum. Resolution
European Journal of Political Economy 83 (2024) 102508
5S. Aiyar et al.
72/191 on Syria was adopted on 19 December 2017. This resolution strongly condemns the grave deterioration of the human rights
situation in Syria, and the indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians.
For each resolution, we consider the pattern of FDI flows from countries which approved the resolution to host countries which
either voted against or abstained. We look at 8 quarters before and 8 quarters after the vote. The results are plotted in Fig. 1.
Notwithstanding some volatility, it is possible to see that the two FDI series diverge after both resolutions, with investments
to opposing countries being much lower than those to countries which approved the resolutions. This evidence, while purely
descriptive, suggests that together with many other established drivers of international capital flows, geopolitical factors could
also influence MNCs’ investment decisions.
3.2. Non-parametric evidence
Next, we provide more general, albeit still suggestive, evidence that geopolitical distance matters for FDI flows. First, countries
are ranked on the basis of their distance from the United States.5Then countries are divided into five groups 𝐺∈ {1,2,…,5}
based on their ranking—very close, close, at a medium distance, far, and very far. A function 𝑔(.) ∶𝐶→{1,2,…,5}from the set
of countries 𝐶to the set of groups {1,2,…,5}is defined such that if a country 𝑖belongs to group 𝐺then𝑔(𝑖) =𝐺. Instances of
FDI taking place between countries in the same group are then counted year by year. Finally, this number is divided by the total
instances of FDI observed in the same year.
The measure of FDI geopolitical concentration in year 𝑡(𝐹𝐷𝐼𝐺𝐶𝑡) is obtained as:
𝐹𝐷𝐼𝐺𝐶𝑡=∑
𝑠∑
𝑑1(𝑔(𝑠) =𝑔(𝑑))𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑠𝑑𝑡∑
𝑠∑
𝑑𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑠𝑑𝑡(1)
where𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑠𝑑𝑡is the sum of instances of FDI from source country 𝑠to destination country 𝑑observed in year 𝑡, and 1(⋅)is the indicator
function taking value 1 if 𝑔(𝑠) =𝑔(𝑑)and 0 otherwise. As there are 25 combinations of groups from {1,2,…,5} × {1,2,…,5}, while
only the FDI taking place between countries belonging to the same group is counted in the numerator in the expression for 𝐹𝐷𝐼𝐺𝐶𝑡,
if geopolitical distance did not matter the measure would equal 0.2; that is, one in five instances of FDI would take place between
geopolitically close (aligned) countries. The top panel of Fig. 2 shows that this is not the case. First, the blue line shows that 𝐹𝐷𝐼𝐺𝐶𝑡
is well above 0.35 throughout the sample. Second, it has increased to more than 0.5 in 2021 and 2022.
As a point of comparison, we plot also an analogous measure based on geographical distance. This line shows that FDI takes
place more frequently between geographically close countries than between countries further apart, but the dashed blue line is
consistently below the solid line blue line and does not show any upward trend, suggesting that geopolitical distance is relatively
more important. The ratio between the two lines summarizes the evolution of their relative importance, increasing from 1.2 in 2003
(the first year of data) to 1.5 in 2022, the last year of the sample. The increasing importance of geopolitical distance is in line with
the thesis that national security concerns are increasingly influencing economic interactions between countries. For example, the
IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), which provides an annual update of trade
and capital flow measures adopted by countries, shows that restrictions motivated by national security concerns have been rising
steadily for the last decade, and have accelerated sharply since about 2015 (Aiyar et al., 2023a). And since July 2018, the US and
China have been engaged in a cycle of escalating bilateral tariffs, together with several other measures intended to curtail bilateral
investment, especially in sensitive sectors (Gros, 2019; Fund, 2023).
To gauge the importance of geopolitical distance for different types of sectors, we repeat the exercise counting separately the
FDI in strategic sectors and other sectors. Measures of FDI concentration are built based on geopolitical and geographic distance,
and their year-by-year ratio is then normalized to one in 2003. The normalized series for the two groups of sectors is reported in
the bottom panel of Fig. 2. The chart shows that the increase in the relative importance of geopolitical distance for FDI decisions
was markedly higher in strategic sectors ( +60 percent) than for other sectors ( +20 percent), and it picked up since 2018.
Finally, we replicate Fig. 2 (panel a) using data on M&As. We find a similar and very striking upward pattern since the late 2010s
in brownfield investment among geopolitically close countries, not matched by a similar trend for flows among geographically close
countries (Appendix Fig. A.2). If anything, the share of brownfield investment taking place between aligned countries is larger
(almost at 60 percent in 2021) than that of greenfield investment.
3.3. A gravity model
Given that various confounders could influence the patterns of Fig. 2, we look at the relationship between geopolitical alignment
and FDI in a standard gravity model. This allows controlling for many bilateral variables and country specific time-varying
factors (Desbordes and Vicard, 2009; Chen and Lin, 2020; Kox and Rojas-Romagosa, 2020), and while the approach does not deliver
purely causal estimates of the impact of geopolitical distance on FDI flows, it yields an informative estimate of the conditional
correlation between the two variables, purged of several confounding factors. Specifically, consider the following equation:
𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑠𝑑𝑡=𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼𝐼𝑃𝐷𝑠𝑑𝑡−1+𝛽𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠𝑠𝑑+𝜏𝑠𝑡+𝜙𝑑𝑡}𝜖𝑠𝑑𝑡, (2)
5Similar results hold if another large country of reference (e.g., China) is chosen.

Fig. 2. FDI flows to geopolitically close countries.
Notes: Panel a plots the share of foreign direct investments in a year taking place between country pairs that are similarly distant from the United States
(i.e., countries in the same quintile of the distance distribution), separately for geopolitical (solid line) and geographical (dashed line) distance. Panel b plots
the ratio of the probability of FDI taking place between geopolitically close countries to the probability of FDI taking place between countries geographically
close, separately for strategic (solid line) and other non-strategic (dashed line) FDI. The ratio is normalized to 1 in 2003. (For interpretation of the references

models, the specification controls for the (logarithm of the) geographical distance between source and destination countries – which
could be correlated with geopolitical distance – and absorbs any unobservable time-varying push and pull factors by adding source

Notes: The table reports the results of the estimation of Eq. (2) by Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood, where the dependent variable is the number (columns

country ×year and destination country ×year fixed effects. These fixed effects capture, for instance, business cycle dynamics which
could instigate FDI outflows from the source country and attract inflows into the destination country. Similarly, factors such as an
increase in political and expropriation risks in the destination country, which are likely to drive FDI flows (Busse and Hefeker, 2007;
Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2017) and are potentially associated with a shift in geopolitical alignment, are controlled for by the fixed
effect𝜙𝑑𝑡. Our strategy keeps constant any change in political and economic risk in the destination country (possibly associated
with a change in government) and just exploits the differential effect that such a change has on the geopolitical alignment across
all source countries.
When interpreting our main results, one should keep in mind that the IPD could still capture the role of other associated
macroeconomic factors. To mitigate this concern, in the robustness analysis we augment the gravity model with variables which
could be associated with changes over time in geopolitical tensions between country pairs (i.e. bilateral imports, bilateral exchange
rates). More fundamentally, even if in the gravity model the IPD is lagged, an important caveat is reverse causality. One could in fact
argue that the direction of causality goes from FDI to geopolitical proximity, as countries could ‘buy’ future political friendship by
increasing FDI. However, a simple regression of the IPD on future and lagged FDI (up to 3 years, controlling for the same variables
and fixed effects as in Eq. (2)) suggests that this may not be the case. The estimates show that all the lags not statistically significant,
while only the contemporaneous value of FDI and the leads are statistically significant (and negative).
Since by construction most of the 𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑠𝑑𝑡cells are zeros, the model is estimated by Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML),
as proposed by Silva and Tenreyro (2006) and implemented by Correia et al. (2020). Standard errors are clustered at the country-pair
level, which is the dimension along which the IPD varies.
Baseline estimates. The main results are shown in Table 1, where the dependent variable is either the number of investments
(Columns 1–3), or their value (columns 4–6). All specifications include time-varying source and destination country fixed effects and
show that a greater geopolitical distance is associated with lower FDI flows. As expected, the estimated coefficient of the IPD becomes
smaller when controlling for geographical distance, as these variables are correlated to the extent that political similarity reflects
in part geographical proximity. Consistent with the literature (see Desbordes and Vicard, 2009; Blonigen and Piger, 2014, among
others), countries which are further away tend to have lower FDI flows (columns 2 and 5). Similar patterns emerge when augmenting
the model with controls for common legal origins, common language, and the presence of a colonial relationship (columns 3 and 6).
The presence of cultural and historical ties is associated with larger FDI flows (Blonigen and Piger, 2014; Kox and Rojas-Romagosa,
2020). However, the interesting result is that the coefficient of IPD remains negative and statistically significant, even if it becomes
smaller in size as part of the original correlation is absorbed by the control variables. The economic significance is substantial. A
quantitative interpretation of the coefficient in column 3 suggests that as the IPD measure rises from the 25th to the 75th percentile
(equivalent to moving the distance from that between South Korea and Japan to that between the UK and Russia), FDI flows between
countries declines by about 15 percent.
Heterogeneous effects. To explore how the importance of IPD for FDI changes across time, samples and types of FDI, we re-estimate
the specification in Eq. (2) by interacting the coefficient 𝛼with various dummies. These results are shown in Fig. 3, and reported
in Appendix Table A.1. First, the yellow bars show that the estimated semi-elasticity of FDI flows to geopolitical alignment has
changed over time. The U-shape of the negative coefficients captures the fact that the negative relationship between IPD and FDI
was declining between the beginning of the sample (2003, soon after China joined the WTO) and 2017, while it has increased since
2018, in line with the economic effects of the surging tensions between China and the United States (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal,
2022). Importantly, the difference in the semi-elasticities between the 2009–17 and 2018–22 periods is statistically significant.

Thus, if countries were to move further apart along geopolitical fault lines, FDI is likely to become more concentrated within blocs
of aligned countries. The blue and red bars in the chart show that the negative relationship between FDI and IPD is driven by
emerging markets and developing economies, both as source and destination economies.6One could argue that coefficient 𝛼picks
up the effect of other factors which are specific to the country-pair and are potentially correlated with IPD. To address this concern
we fully saturate equation (2) with country-pair fixed effects, which would absorb all these sources of heterogeneity. In this case, the
interpretation of the coefficient 𝛼is more restrictive and within country-pair. This means that the coefficient 𝛼picks up the effect
of a deviation in geopolitical proximity between the source and the destination country on FDI flows. When limiting the analysis
to flows directed to emerging and developing countries, the coefficient of IPD is not only larger, but also robust to the inclusion of
country-pair fixed effects.7Finally, the green bars report the coefficient on IPD from two different regressions: one in which only
FDI that is classified as strategic is included in the sample, and one in which only FDI in other sectors is included. The results show
that the importance of IPD for FDI is larger for strategic sectors than other sectors.
Robustness. Our main findings are robust to alternative measures of geopolitical distance, to the inclusion of additional control
variables, and to alternative samples.
We start by considering how to measure geopolitical proximity. First, we show that the results are robust to replacing the IPD
measure with the rank of the destination country with respect to the source country in the IPD distribution ( Table 2, column 1),
or with alternative indicators of geopolitical distance, such as the 𝑆score (proposed by Signorino and Ritter , 1999 , column 2) or
the𝜋score (proposed by Häge , 2011 , column 3). These two measures are based on data on military alliances from the Alliance
6Further analysis reveals that the association between IPD and FDI flows is driven especially by South–South flows (i.e., when both the source and the
destination country is an emerging market or a developing economy).
7The Appendix Table A.2 shows that, once controlling for country-pair fixed effects, the elasticity of FDI (measured either as number of projects or USD
value) to the IPD is smaller than in the baseline specification (columns 3 and 6), but still statistically significant (columns 4 and 8). We also find that the
coefficient on the IDP becomes smaller (around half that of the baseline) but retains its statistical significance in the whole sample, but only when measuring
FDI by its value.

Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) dataset (version 5.1) and they are highly correlated with the ideal point distance.8Thus,
we can interpret all these indicators as proxies for geopolitical proximity, as reflected either in UNGA voting patterns or in military
alliances. We also replicate our analysis scaling the dependent variable by the total number (or value) of FDI from the source country
in a given year. The results reported in Appendix Table A.3 are in line with the baseline and they are also robust to the inclusion
of country-pair fixed effects, when considering the number of projects (column 4).
Next, we augment the model with a set of other time-varying bilateral variables which could drive FDI flows and be associated
with geopolitical distance. In column 4 we control for the announcement and implementation of bilateral trade barriers, as measured
by Global Trade Alerts, which show no significant association with FDI but do not affect the estimation of the coefficient on the
IPD. Then, we control for the intensity of trade flows, measured by bilateral imports (column 5), and by the annual change in the
bilateral exchange rate (column 6).9Both variables are associated with FDI flows, which are larger for country pairs that trade
more and when the exchange rate of the source country appreciates. We also control for the difference in short-term interest rates
between destination and host countries as a proxy for difference in returns to investment.10We find no correlation with FDI flows
and, importantly, no change on our coefficient of interest (column 7). Even controlling jointly for these factors, the semi-elasticity
between geopolitical distance and FDI remains stable and precisely estimated (column 8).11
Finally, we estimate the baseline specification in different samples (Table 3). The semi-elasticity is similar when restricting the
sample to only manufacturing FDI (column 1) or services FDI (column 2), or when excluding country pairs that never registered an
instance of FDI during the sample period (column 3). The results are also robust to excluding China, which could disproportionately

affect the results by virtue of being both a large source and destination of FDI, especially among emerging and developing economies
(column 4). Finally, limiting the analysis to the 52 commodity exporters in our sample (either as destination or source countries)

Brownfield investment. The analysis discussed so far is based on greenfield investment. To be able to generalize our conclusions to
gross FDI flows, we replicate our baseline results using bilateral data on cross-border M&As from 2003 to 2021 from the Refinitiv
Eikon database, aggregated at the country-year level in terms of both number of deals and value (in USD). Consistent with our main
results, we find that brownfield FDI flows are significantly lower between countries which are more geopolitically distant (Table 4).

4. Conclusions
The analysis presented in this paper shows that FDI flows are increasingly concentrated among countries which are geopolitically
aligned, especially in strategic sectors such as semiconductors. First, a simple measure of FDI geopolitical concentration shows that
the likelihood that FDI take place between geopolitically aligned countries is more than twice higher than one would expect if FDI
were taking place independent of geopolitical considerations over the almost two decades spanned by our data. Second, we show
that in more recent years this likelihood is about 2.5 times higher, suggesting that the relevance of geopolitics for FDI decisions has
increased over time. In interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind that the gravity model does not yield an estimate of
the impact of geopolitical distance on FDI flows, but rather provides an informative estimate of the conditional correlation between
the two variables, purged of several confounding factors. Third, conditional on standard ‘‘gravity’’ variables, we confirm that an
increase in IPD from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution is associated with a 15 percent decline in FDI. Finally, we
document that the semi-elasticity of FDI to IPD has increased over time, in tandem with the resurgence of trade tensions between
the U.S. and China since 2018, and it is larger when the receiving countries are emerging economies and when an investment takes
place in a strategic sector.
Our results suggest that if geopolitical tensions continue to rise and countries move further apart along geopolitical fault lines,
FDI is likely to become ever more segregated within blocs of aligned countries, potentially leading to global output losses. As a
large literature has documented (see Goerg et al., 2003; Navaretti and Venables, 2004; Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare, 2010, for a
review), FDI can play an important role in creating jobs, fostering knowledge diffusion and facilitating capital accumulation in host
countries – especially in poorer ones – leading to positive real effects.
FDI fragmentation is only one dimension of a more general trend towards cross-border economic interactions – including trade
and technology sharing – being increasingly driven by geopolitical considerations (Aiyar et al., 2023b). Overall, geoeconomic
fragmentation across multiple dimensions is likely to lead to large global output losses, disproportionately concentrated in emerging
markets and low-income countries. Reversing this trend, or at least mitigating the worst consequences of fragmentation will require
sustained policy effort at both the national and multilateral levels. Aiyar et al. (2023a) suggest a number of approaches. For truly
global issues such as climate change and pandemic-preparedness, multilateral cooperation remains absolutely essential. In areas
where country preferences are not aligned, and multilateral cooperation is not a practical option, open and non-discriminatory
plurilateral initiatives (such as deep regional free trade agreements) could open a way forward. When countries choose to pursue
unilateral measures, internationally-agreed ‘‘guardrails’’ could aim to mitigate unintended spillovers and protect the most vulnerable
(such as ‘‘safe corridors’’ for food and medicine). Much work will be needed in the coming years to reach international agreement
on policy frameworks that adjust to the new realities of heightened geopolitical sensitivities while preserving as far as possible the
benefits of global economic integration.

Notes: The table reports the results of the estimation of Eq. (2) by Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood, where the dependent variable is the number (columns
1–4) or the value (columns 5–8) of FDI projects, scaled by the total number of FDI (columns 1–4) or the total USD value of FDI (columns 5–8) from the source
country in a given year. The sample spans the period 2003–2022. Standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the source–destination pair level. ***, **, and
* denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
