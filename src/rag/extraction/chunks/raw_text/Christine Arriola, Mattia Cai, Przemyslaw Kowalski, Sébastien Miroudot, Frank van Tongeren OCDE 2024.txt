  Towards Demystifying Trade Dependencies:  
At What Point do Trade Linkages Become a Concern?

Supply chain disruptions related to natural events or geopolitical tensions have in recent years 
prompted policy makers to identify potential vulnerabilities related to critical trade dependencies ― 
commercial links that could potentially impose significant economic or societal harm, be a source of 
coercion, a risk to national security, or disrupt strategic activities. Using three complementary 
methodologies — detailed trade data analysis, input output data techniques, and computable general 
equilibrium (CGE) modelling  — this paper examines the nature and evol ution of trade dependencies 
between the OECD countries and major non -OECD economies (MNOE). It shows that global 
production has become increasingly concentrated at the product level, with China representing 15% 
of import dependencies in strategic products for OECD countries in 2020 -21 compared to 4% in 1997 -
99. The methodologies used in this paper unanimously demonstrate a high degree of trade 
interdependency between OECD and MNOE countries. The current debate on “de-risking ” 
international trade, therefore,  needs to carefully consider the possible costs and benefits of different 
policy choices .

  Key findings  and messages  
This report examines the nature and evolution of trade dependencies in OECD and major -non-OECD 
economies (MNOEs)1 combin ing detailed trade data analysis, input -output data techniques and 
computable general equilibrium  (CGE)  modelling.  
Concentration of global and national trade  and bilateral import dependencies  
• Since the late 1990s, both global exports and imports of p roducts2 have become 
gradually more concentrated , featuring fewer exporters and importers, and global exports of 
products are currently , on average , two times more concentrated than imports.  
• There is a considerable variation in levels of export concentration across different products: 
exports of close  to 30% of products are relatively highly concentrated , but the remainder 
are relatively well diversified. This suggests that  large portions  of international  product 
markets are characterised by a reasonable  degree of competition , and that specific 
exporters and importers have a limited control over supply or price formation.  
• Countries typically source their imports from  — and ship their exports to  — fewer 
partners than is in principle globally possible . Concentrations of national imports have  also 
grown more quickly  than concentrations of national exports  and this might explain the current 
focus in public debate on import dependencies.  
• The relatively higher country -level concentration of imports  likely reflect s a combination 
of natural factors , such as the role of geography and trade costs  in global value chains 
(GVCs), as well as countries’ preferences and policies  (e.g. preferential trade agreements , 
strategic economic policies of importers and exporters ). In particular, the rise in national import 
concentration has coincided with raising shares of The People’s Republic of China  (hereafter 
“China”)  as a source of imports while shares of  the other major trading partners fell.  
• ‘Excessive concentration’ of national imports , where countries rely on significantly fewer 
suppliers than is offered by international markets, has increased globally but this increase is 
accounted for by mainly MNOEs an d other non -OECD countries, while  excessive import 
concentration has decreased on average for OECD countries.  
• This suggest s that a significant portion of firms and consumers in at least some  OECD 
countries have been able to take advantage of diversificatio n possibilities offered by 
international markets . 
• Relatively high import  value  shares  can be attributed to relatively few highly 
concentrated bilateral import links . This means that, b eyond being of interest to  specific 
countries , sectors, firms and consumers , such dependencies  may also matter for the economy 
as a whole .

to the  relationships  between the OECD or any of its members and any of the individual countries of the MNOE 
grouping.

OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  • The average per country incidence of bilateral import dependencies3 has declined both 
across the OECD and MNOEs  since the late 1990s, and the decline was more rapid for OECD 
countrie s which are now on average less dependent than MNOEs.  
• Among the G7 countries, Canada  and Japan recorded the highest incidence  of bilateral 
import dependencies  overall and for a list of ‘strategic’ products and their dependency levels 
were some 50% higher than that of Germany which had the lowest level of dependency in 
the OECD grouping .4 Among the selected smaller OECD countries covered in this analysis, 
Korea recorded a level of depend encies which approached that of Canada and Japan  
and was about 20% higher than those of Australia , the Netherlands, Spain, Poland and 
Sweden .  
• In the MNOE grouping, Indonesia recorded the highest levels of import dependencies  
which were about 20% higher th an those for the Russia n Federation (hereafter “Russia”)  
and China which had the lowest dependency levels in this country group . 
• Bilateral import dependencies tend to be concentrated regionally  which is consistent with 
patterns of regional trade integratio n and with the regional nature of GVCs which tend to be 
centred around the three large manufacturing hubs and consumer markets of the United 
States, the EU and China . The EU appears as the region with some of the lowest levels 
of import dependencies in the OECD  especially since  most  of the concentrated import 
linkages  of EU countries are with participants of the E uropean  single market . The high degree 
of trade integration in this market along with r egulatory provisions and institutions lower the 
risk of shocks and  facilitate adjustments when such shocks occur.  
Interdependencies between the OECD countries and China  
• Asian countries5 ― and China in particular  ― are the most prominent trans -regional 
counterparts in import dependencies across  the globe  and the level of dependency on 
Asia has increased significantly across all OECD regions  since the late 1990s.  
• For the OECD region as a whole, the number of bilateral dependencies on China has gone 
up, notwithstanding  the declin e in the  total number of such dependencies on any 
country . Most recently , China accounted for some 14% of all OECD countries’ import 
dependencies of ‘strategic’ products6, more than three times as much as in the late 1990s.  
• A yet more pronounced expansion of trad e dependency on China can be observed for 
its MNOE partners for which the share of dependencies on China in ‘strategic’ products 
increased from approximately 6 to 23% in the  same period.  
• Overall,  China is an important and growing counterpart in OECD import dependencies  
but dependencies  on China vary considerably across the different OECD regions, countries 
and sectors.  
 
 
3 A country’s import  of a product is considered dependent  on a p articular trade partner  if a high share of its import 
is sourced fr om that partner and if country sources the product from only a few partners  making it hard to find 
alternative sources  should a supply disruption occur . This is considered one bilateral trade dependency  in this 
study . 
4 Import dependencies of EU countries referred to here , include bilateral trade links with other EU Members if 
they meet the adopted dependency criteria. If intra -EU links were excluded, the incidence of dependenci es in EU 
countries would be even lower.  
5 This categorisation includes both OECD and non -OECD Asian countries.  
6 Identified based on recent literature.

OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  • The shares of China  in dependencies exceed ed 10% in several ‘strategic’ industries  for 
the OECD and , within that,  EU, as groups of countries and notably for the Netherlands 
individually (e.g. manufacture of refractory products , cutting, shaping and finishing of stone, 
manufacture of pharmaceuticals,  medicinal chemical and botanical products , manufacture of 
lifting and ha ndling equipment , manufacture of  consumer electronics , and manufacture of 
electronic components and boards ). 
• That said, China is more dependent on  OECD countries than vice versa . Most recently , 
OECD countries as a group  accounted for approximately 70% of China’s import dependencies 
in ‘strategic’ products. Japan and the United States were the two ind ividual OECD countries 
which accounted for the highest —albeit declining —portions of import dependencies 
(respectively at 15 and 1 2% in 2020 -21), while  the EU as group has become progressively 
more important, most recently account ing for 29% of import dependencies .  
• Together with Germany, Italy, France and Sweden,  the Netherlands was among  the top  5 
EU countries that account ed for the highest shares of China’s import dependencies in 
‘strategic ’ products . The Netherlands  alone account ed for 2% of China’s dependencies in 
2020 -21. 
• The high levels of import dependency of China on OECD countries can be seen across 
most of ‘strategic ’ products it imports .  
• The EU alone, for example , accounts  for more than 40% of import dependencies  in a 
long list of China’s ‘strategic’ industries (e.g. manufacture of motor vehicles , manufacture of 
pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical and botanical prod ucts, manufacture of bearings, gears, 
gearing and driving elements , manufacture of lifting and handling equipment , manufacture of 
ovens, furnaces and furnace burners ).  
• China’s sectoral import dependencies involving OECD countries include several industries in 
which several OECD countries also depend on China  for imports , which underscores the  
mutual nature of these dependencies .  
Possible implications of reduced trade between the OECD and major non -OECD countries  
• The hypothetical trade reduction s cenarios used  in the input -output and CGE modelling part s 
of this analysis  considered a 10% reduction of all bilateral goods and services trade flows 
between each of the OECD countries and each of the MNOEs , while all the other flows 
were assumed to be not  directly affected (hereafter ‘trade shock’).7This is a fairly stylised trade 
reduction scenario and the estimated impacts should be interpreted as such . 
• Overall, the results confirm the relatively high degree of trade interdependence between 
the two groups of countries (and especially between OECD countries and China)  and 
illustrate some of the economic costs that may be involved in some of the currently debated 
strategies f or ‘de-risking’ international trade , esp ecially  if the  latter  would lead to significant 
trade reductions . 
• Most OECD and MNOE countries lose in the trade reduction scenario , notwithstanding  
significant variation  between countries , including  relatively small  impacts . 
 
 
7 They can be nevertheless affected indirectly, for example through interruption of indirect links involving OECD -
MNOE trade, if such links exist, or through redirection of trade and other economic adjustments.

  Impacts on OECD countries  
• In the OECD countries, GDP  declines range from nil to about 1.4% depending on the country 
and the modelling approach used. As expected , OECD countries and sectors with stronger 
trade linkages with MNOEs rather than the OECD fare worse  while s tronger linkages within 
the OECD help mitigate the impacts of the trade shock.  
• OECD countries in the Asia Pacific, in particular Korea and Australia, are affected the 
most  (GDP declines ranging from about 0.1% to 1.4%). This is due to their  relatively strong 
intermediate  and final product linkages with MNOEs, particularly China , but also Indonesia and 
India.  
• The OECD countries of North America (Canada, Mexico and the United States) come 
across as  largely unaffected . This is explained by their lower direct trade  exposure to 
MNOEs as well as the fact that the negative effects of reducing inputs from MNOEs are 
outweighed by market gains domestically and abroad, especially in markets of OECD partners 
who also cut supplies from MNOEs and where they are  in a strong position to com pete, 
including within the USMCA market . 
• EU countries are somewhere in between, with Germany and the Netherlands appearing 
relatively more exposed  than other EU Members (GDP declines ranging from about 0.03 to 
0.6%)  due to compound effects across manufactu ring and services .  
• Across the EU, exposure to trade with MNOEs appears  relatively high in important 
manufacturing sectors , such as  machinery , chemicals  and electronics , which experience the 
largest declines  in value added  resulting from a decline in export demand . At the same time, 
some services industries with a close connection to trade ( e.g. transport and 
wholesaling) also tend to experience above -average declines  in value added and this is 
important for economies such as that of the Netherlands where tran sport and logistical services 
are important contributors to GDP and household incomes.   
• Indeed, the Netherlands ’ economy is exposed not only across the manufacturing 
industries but also for several types of services  which are affected by the trade shock and  
which account also for significant shares of GDP ( e.g. legal services, IT services , wholesale 
trade  and shipping and transport services ). 
• Across all OECD regions, the main driver of these GDP reductions is the decreas e in trade 
with China , although some OECD countries have also noticeable exposures to other MNOEs . 
Impacts on MNOEs  
• The trade shock modelled is found to hurt the GDPs of some MNOE s even more than those 
of OECD countries . This is because  the export and import links  which are being disrupted in 
this scenario  represent a larger share of the economy in MNOEs .  
• Russia loses the most  (GDP declines ranging from about 0.1% to 1.7%), followed by China  
(0.1 to 1%), while India, South Africa, Indon esia, and Brazil experience somewhat smaller 
losses (0.02 to 0.9%).  
• Different countries in the MNOE grouping have tighter trade linkages with different OECD 
regions and this determines the nature of their exposure to the trade shock  with some being 
more ex posed to reduced trade with Europe ( e.g. South Africa, Russia) and some with North 
America (e.g. China, India and Brazil).

OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  Impacts acros s industries  
• The list of industries which are most impacted in terms of output, as well as  through direct and 
indirect channels, varies from one country to another, but it is fairly common to find high levels 
of exposure in industries belonging to the mining and quarrying cluster  and other 
primary industries .  
• The list of relatively  highly impa cted industries also includes a number of advanced 
manufacturing industries, such as electronics .  
Conclusions and implications  
• The results of this analysis illustrate some of the concerns that lie behind  the debate on 
trade dependencies  in the context of increasingly uncertain global economic and geopolitical 
environments . Some findings support a  cautious approach to concentrated trade relations 
while others are more reassurin g.  
• The growth in concentration of supply and demand , and its clu stering around some countries 
and regions,  suggest  an increase d potential for disrupt ion of  commercial links , caus ing 
economic or societal damage , as well as  the potential for trade to be used as a tool of 
economic coercion . 
• Having said that, the evidence presented shows also that large, if not dominant, portions of 
global and national trade are relatively well diversified,  that several countries —most 
notably within the OECD group —have used international markets to diversify a nd reduce 
dependency,  and that there is also untapped potential to diversify further.  
• It is difficult to distinguish concentrated trade links that could cause problems from 
advantageous trade linkages . Concern s that policy responses which aim to minimise trade 
risks and improve supply chain resilience may not be well designed  and may in fact 
unnecessarily undermine the benefits of international trade  are therefore also legitimate.  
• The rise of China as the main counterpart in trade dependencies of OECD coun tries 
calls for a better understanding of underlying natural and policy -related factors , 
including policies which may have involved market distortions or targeted non -economic 
objectives. Trade  dependencies of OECD economies on China also need to be put in  the 
context of China’s dependencies on OECD  economies, which appear even larger . 
• The current debate on ‘de -risking’ international trade needs to consider c arefully  the possible 
costs and benefits  of different policy choices . The different methodologies used to produce 
evidence unanimously demonstrate a relatively high degree of trade interdependence between 
the OECD and MNOE countries (and especially  between OECD countries and China) as well 
as potentially high economic costs of  significant  trade fragmentation .  
• OECD countries in Asia and Pacific appear to bear the highest cost s from  
fragmentation, followed by Europe  (where Germany and the Netherlands are affected more 
than the average), while OECD countries in North America record lower imp acts. MNOEs,

  Summary  
Purpose  and approach  
There is a growing interest in identifying ‘critical trade dependencies’ which can be broadly defined 
as commercial links that could cause high ec onomic or societal damage in case of unexpected 
disruptions, or those that could be used as a tool of coercion or that might create national security 
risks, weigh on countries’ sovereignty or undermine economic or non -economic activities deemed as 
‘strategic’ (hereafter ‘trade dependencies’). At the same time, what is considered ‘strategic’ is often 
country -specific and it is difficult to distinguish  such  trade  dependencies from otherwise 
advantageous trade linkages . There is  thus concern that policy responses which aim to minimise 
trade risks and improve supply chain resilience may not be well designed and may in fact 
unnecessarily undermine the benefits of international trade  or have unwanted or unintended effects . 
This report has been commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands with a view 
of harnessing analytical work undertaken in this area at the OECD and shedding more empirical light 
on the question of trade dependencies, not only in the Neth erlands but also across the wider OECD 
membership as well as in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russi a and South Africa (which are 
thereafter referred to in this report as ‘major non -OECD economies’, or ‘MNOEs’).8  
There is currently no commonly agreed d efinition of trade dependencies  nor an established approach 
to measuring them. C oncerns that lie be hind the debate on trade dependencies are also often non -
economic. Economic analysis can nevertheless help draw a more comprehensive picture of some of 
the e conomic characteristics of global and national trade linkages which have been put forward as 
exemplifying trade dependencies. As such, it can help assess the economic costs and benefits 
associated with different policy options.  
The emerging economic  literature  in this field  suggests that trade dependencies can be defined as 
trade flows combin ing the following three characteristics: high risk of disruption; high economic (or 
other) importance; and constrained possibility of substitution (Figure 1). Analysis  undertaken in this 
report  combines different methods to measure  some of these characteristics . Potential dependencies 
identified in this way can be further scrutinised in detail from multidisciplinary angles, and can 
integrate geopolitical, or other , perspectives on risk.  
The report starts with a review of the emerging economic literature , focusing on definitions and 
methodologies used to define and measure trade dependencies ( Chapter  2). This is followed by a 
descriptive statistical analysis of global trade data at a detailed product level through  the lens of trade 
shares and trade concentrations in order to provide an overview of the possible extent, character 
and evolution of dependencies over the last thirty years ( Chapter  3). In o rder to better capture some 
of the economy -wide dimensions of trade dependencies, and to take into account  trade diversification 
and other economic adjustments in the event of shocks, the analysis further considers possible 
economic implications of a hypot hetical scenario that partially reduce s trade between the OECD and 
MNOE  countries. This scenario is analysed using the OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA) data and 
Inter-Country Input -Output technique s (Chapter  4) and the OECD’s computable general equilibrium  
(CGE) trade model METRO ( Chapter  5). Chapter  6 concludes and outlines some preliminary 
implications.  
 
 
8 This country focus is purely analytical and is without prejudice to the  relationships  between the OECD or 
any of its members and any of the individual countries of the MNOE grouping . Brazil, China, India, Indonesia 
and South Africa have all been designated by the OECD as its Key Partners with a view  to enhancing their 
involvement in the daily work of the OECD, promoting the sharing of perspectives and policy approaches 
through their partnerships with OECD bodies, promoting adherence to OECD legal instruments and 
integration in the Organisation’s stat istical databases and policy indicators (see https://www.oecd.org/global -
relations/keypartners/ ). In addition, in 2022 the OECD Council opened accession dis cussions with Brazil and  
in February 2024 with  Indonesia.

  The time period covered by the analysis varies due to data requirements of the methodologies  used . 
The descriptive analysis of trade data in Chapter  3 covers the period 1997 -2021, although , due to 
large and often temporary changes in the structure of trade during the COVID -19 pandemic , 2019  is 
often used as the most recent data point  relevant for long -term comparisons . The Inter-Country Input -
Output ( ICIO) analyses presented in Chapter  4 are carried out on the basis of data for 2019, the most 
recent non -pandemic year for which data are available . Finally, t he base data used in the CGE 
modellin g in Chapter  5 are for 2017. The analysis presented in this report therefore does not cover 
some of the most recent disruptive events which deepened concerns about trade dependencies such 
as the economic and geopolitical ramifications of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The extent and evolution of concentration of global trade  
One measure of tr ade dependency is reliance on only a few suppliers (exporters) or markets 
(importers). If total trade of a product is accounted for by only a few partners, in other words is highly 
concentrated, countries may find it hard to find alternatives in the face o f disruptions in foreign supply 
or demand.  
Since the late 1990s, both global exports and imports of products (defined at the H armonized System 
6-digit (HS6) level of product aggregation) have become gradually more concentrated across, 
respectively, exporting and importing countries. This likely reflects finer levels of specialisation in 
global value chains (GVCs) which proliferated during this period. It is a lso consistent with the 
perception of an increase in vulnerabili ties to unexpected shocks  transmitted through international 
trade and supply chains.  
Global exports of products  are currently on average two times more concentrated across exporting 
countries than imports are across importing countries. But there is also a considerable variation in 
levels of export concentration across different products: exports of close to 30% of products are 
relatively highly concentrated  but e xports of the rest of internati onally traded products are relatively 
well diversified. This suggests that large portions of  international product markets are characterised 
by a reasonable amount of competition, and that specific exporters and importers have a limited 
control over supply  or price formation . 
Perhaps surprisingly, t he lists of products with the highest average export  concentrations , do not 
seem to be dominated by products that are typically referred to  in public debates as ‘strategic’ and 
which often feature critical raw ma terials  (hereafter CRMs), which are used intensely as upstream

  inputs in green and digital technologies,  and products of advanced manufactur ing industries  such as 
electronics, machinery or motor vehicles . Instead, products with some of the highest levels o f export 
concentration feature , for example,  a range of products of light manufacturing industries (e.g. textiles 
and footwear or headgear). Zooming in on a list of products of some of the strategic industries 
identified in  the recent literature9 (hereaft er ‘strategic products’ or ‘strategic industries’), the analysis 
presented in Chapter  3 found that such products  are in fact on average somewhat less export - and 
import -concentrated than all traded  merchandise  products.   
This is not to say that the levels of concentration seen for CRMs or advanced manufacturing products 
are not of concern but rather that, for many products which are emphasised as  ‘strategic’ in recent 
public debates, international markets in fact offer good options for diversification  in line with those 
available for other traded product s. This also highlights  multiple factors which likely drive production 
and trade  concentration , such as natural endowments, comparative advantage, low costs of 
production an d processing, and economies of scale.  
Concentration of national imports and exports  
Having said th at, concentrations of nationa l imports and exports  tend to be higher  than their global 
equivalent s and they have increased since the late 1990s, includin g for our list of strategic products 
(Figure 2).10 This means that countries typically source their imports from  — and ship their exports 
to — fewer partners than is in principle globally possible. Countries  are importing from fewer partners 
(their  imports have become more concentrated ) throughout the investigated period . At the same time , 
countries are exporting to fewer markets although  export concentration has grown less quickly  which  
might explain the foc us in public debate on import dependencies.  
The relatively higher country -level concentrations  of trade  likely reflect a combination of natural 
factors, such as the role of geography and trade costs , particularly in the context of GVC s which 
remain concen trated regional ly, as well as countries’ preferences and policies  which have been 
revealed for example in the expansion of regional and preferential trade agreements which by design 
tend to lower trade costs and give other advantages to selected trade part ners, contributing thereby 
to trade concentration.   
Strategic economic policies of importers and exporters could also have played a role.  On the export 
side, China may be a case in point as the  overall  rise in  national import concentration s of other 
nation s has coincided with  raising shares  of China as a source of imports  (Figure 2, Panel B).  
Evaluat ing the extent to which countries rely on significantly fewer suppliers (national import 
concentration) than is offered by the global economy (global export con centration) reveals that the 
overall  incidence of such ‘ excessive import concentration ’ of national imports has been on the rise in 
the investigated period. Nevertheless, this has been accounted for mainly by MNOEs and other 
countries, while excessive import concentration has decreased somewhat on average for OECD 
countries (Figure 3). This suggests that to some extent firms and consumers in OECD countries have 
been able to take  advantage of diversification possibilities offered by international markets.   
 
 
9 A list of strategic products and industries studied in this work follows the study of fragmentation of FDI by  
IMF (2023 [18]) which had built on a list of sectors designated as strategic in study by the Atlantic Council 
(Tran, 2022 [40]).  
10 The increases and other changes observed in the most recent period are related to more geographically 
concentra ted sourcing of imports, and, generally, other large, but not necessarily permanent, changes in the 
product and country compositions of trade which occurred during the COVID -19 pandemic. This means that 
the trends observed for the period 1999_98_97 – 2019_ 18_17 are deemed more telling of medium to long 
term trends than what may be observed for 1999_98_97 to 2021_20. ‘1999_98_97’, ‘2004_03_02’, etc., 
denote the averages for the three -year periods 1999, 1998 and 1997; 2002, 2003 and 2004; and so on. 
These ave rages are used to reduce the influence on calculations  of unusually high or low data records in 
specific years.

Note: “excessive import concentration is defined in cases of bilateral import links at the produ ct level where the value of country -level HHI 
for imports is more than double the value of the corresponding HHI for global exports. To further constrain the spectrum of c ases of 
excessive concentration, an additional minimum cut -off value of HHI calculate d for global product -level exports was set at 0.2. This means 
that only products with a global exports HHI of at least 0.2 and products with country -level imports HHI of at least 0.4 were considered.  
The category ‘others’ comprises all non -OECD, non MNOE c ountries for which data is available in the BACI database.

Bilateral trade dependencies  
Identifying which trading partners countries rely on the most among highly concentrated trade linkages 
has been raised as  one of the key issues in the trade dependency debate. This is because geographic , 
economic  and geopolitical  risks are often related to the country affiliation or geographical location of 
trading partners.  
In this report, a country’s trade of a product with a specific partner is considered dependen t in a given 
period if: 1) a relatively high share of the country’s imports (exports) comes from (is exported to) the 
specific  partner ; and at the same time ; and  2) the country cannot easily replace these specific bilateral 
imports (exports) with alternative sources  (markets)  because the country imports from (exports to) 
relatively few suppliers (markets)  or, in other words, the overall concentration of their  nation al imports  
(exports)  of these products is high . 
As far as imports are concerned, such dependencies account for 4.9% of all active bilateral  import 
links across the OECD and for 4.6% across the MNOEs. In value terms, they account  for respectively 
42 and 45%  of the total values of imports of these country groups. This suggests that in both these 
groups high portions of imports can be attributed to relatively few highly concentrated bilateral import 
links11 and reminds that, beyond being of interest to  specifi c countries , sectors, firms and consumers , 
dependencies  may also matter for the economy as a whole . 
 
 
11 In the Netherlands, for example, bilateral import dependencies in the electrical and electronic products  
(Chapter HS85 in the 2 -digit version UN’s Harmonised System) accounted for only 0.1% of the country’s all 
bilateral import linkages in the period 2017 -19 (altogether 235,086 bilateral linkages at the 6 -digit level of product

than in the MNOE grouping  
Average number  of bilateral import dependencies per country in each of the country grouping  
 
Source: OECD calculations using the BACI data . 
Having said that,  the average per country incidence of bilateral import dependencies declined both 
across the OECD and MNOEs in t he analysed period and the decline was more rapid for OECD 
countries (Figure 4). These findings are confirmed when only ‘strategic’ products are considered and 
when trade shares are studied instead of counts.  
There is also  important heterogeneity within t hese  country  group s. Among the selected OECD 
countries that were studied in more detail in this report, within the G7 grouping, Canada  overtook 
Japan in the mid -2010s and was the G7 country with the highest level of bilateral import 
dependencies in the mos t recent periods. Both these countries had markedly higher levels of all and 
‘strategic’ dependencies than the other G7 countries, where dependencies generally decreased, 
although the  dependencies of  United States increase d temporarily in the aftermath of the Global 
Financial Crisis of 2008 -09. Germany12 saw one of the most impressive decreases in dependencies 
and had the lowest level of import dependencies among G7 countries throughout the period.  
Among the selected smaller OECD countries, Korea has maintained a level of dependencies  which 
was similar to  that of Canada and was  markedly higher than that of Australia , the Netherlands, Spain, 
Poland and Sweden , all of which recorded similar moderate and generally decreasing levels of 
dependencies . 
The MNOE grouping presents a more diverse picture as the leve ls of dependency across all products 
were more stable than across ‘strategic’ products, for which dependencies increased gradually i n 
some countries . The growth of dependencies in ‘strategic’ products has been the most pronounced 
in India and Indonesia and  to a lesser extent in South Africa. Brazil, China and Russia recorded 
decrease s in ‘strategic’ dependencies in the period 2007 -19 which were  nevertheless reversed

dependencies in machinery and equipment  (HS84) accounted for 0.2% of all bilateral links, but they accounted 
for 3% of the overall value of imports.  
12 Import dependencies of EU countries referred to here , include b ilateral trade links with other EU Members if 
they meet the adopted dependency criteria. If intra -EU links were excluded, the incidence of dependencies in EU 
countries would be even lower.

  somewhat during the COVID -19 pandemic. Indonesia  has maintained the highest level of 
depende ncies in the MNOE grouping across both ‘strategic’ and all product categories. From the 
mid-2010s, Russia and China recorded the lowest levels of import dependencies in the MNOE 
grouping across both product categories.   
Regional dimensions of bilateral dep endencies  
Import  dependencies  tend to be concentrated regionally. Among the OECD countries, for example, 
Canada, Mexico, and the United States tend to have a relatively high proportion (44% on average,  
Figure 5) of their dependencies with each other and with other countries in the Ame ricas. For the Asian 
OECD countries approximately 51% of dependencies on average originate within Asia  and an  even 
higher share of import dependencies for EU countries is with EU partners (77%). Such regional 
concentration of dependencies is consistent wit h the regional nature of integration in GVCs, which is 
centred around the three large manufacturing hubs and consumer markets of the United States, the 
EU and China.

For the participants of the European single market, these findings reflect the high level of international 
trade integration within  this market achieved through advanced provisions establishing  free 
movement of goods, services, people and capital among  participating countries . Due to the high 
depth of economic integration in the European single market , some types of idiosyncratic  shocks are 
less likely within this area  and, when shocks occur,  regulatory provisions and  institutions  in place 
facilitate  adjustment.  Taking this into a ccount,  the EU comes across  as the region  with some of the 
lowest levels of trade dependencies in the OECD . 
Bilateral import dependencies feature also remarkable trans -regional patterns and developments. 
First, OECD countries in the Americas are more depen dent on OECD countries located in Europe 
(20% of these countries’ dependencies originate in Europe) than European countries are on 
countries located in the Americas (5%).

  Second, Asian countries  — and China in particular  — are the most prominent trans -regional 
counterparts in import dependencies  globally . The level of dependency on Asia has increased 
significantly across all OECD regions since the late 1990s. For example, while in the period 1997 -99 
Asia accounted for on average 17 and 10% of dependencies in, respectively, the OECD countries 
located in Americas and Europe, in the 2017 -19 these shares increased to 34 and 16%. The 
expansion of import dependencies on China and other Asian countries was the most prominent for 
the two OECD countries located in O ceania (Australia and New Zealand) where it increased from 
30% in 1997 -99 to 49% in 2017 -2019. This region is also the only one in which the share of 
dependencies originating in Asia exceeds the share of intra -regional ones (12%).  
Interdependencies between the OECD countries and China  
Throughout the different OECD regions, the bulk of the increase in dependency on Asia has been 
accounted for by China. For the OECD region as a whole, the number of bilateral dependencies on 
China has gone up in contrast to the total number of such dependencies on any country which 
actually decreased.  
Most recently,  China accounted for some 14% of all OECD countries’ import dependencies in 
strategic products, more than three times as much as in 1997 -99 (4%) while the corresponding 
shares of the most prominent counterparts within the OECD membership  — Germany and the United 
States  — declined (Figure 6).  The average shares of China in import dependencies of OECD 
countries located in Europe and the America s increased from, respectively, 2 and 5% in 1997 -99 to 
8 and 21% in 2017 -19. OECD countries of Asia and Oceania are even more exposed (respectively, 
24 and 25% of dependencies on China in 2017 -19).

  A yet more pronounced expansion of trade dependency on China can be observed for the MNOE 
countries for which the  share of dependencies on China increased from approximately 6% in 1997 -
99 to 23% in 2017 -19.  
Overall, the extent of import dependency on China across OECD countries  has grown although it still 
seems relatively moderate and varies considerably across the different OECD sectors and countries. 
For the OECD and EU groupings, as well as for the Netherlands individually, China does not 
manifestly account for unusually high  shares of dependencies in ‘strategic’ product categories where 
these regions record the highest overall levels of dependency (e.g. manufacture of cement, lime and 
plaster , manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds , manufacture of plastics and synt hetic 
rubber in primary forms , manufacture of watches and clocks  and m ining of other non -ferrous metal 
ores). Nevertheless, China’s share of dependencies exceeds 10% in several ‘strategic’ industries 
such as manufacture of refractory products , cutting, sha ping and finishing of stone , manufacture of 
pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical and botanical products , manufacture of lifting and handling 
equipment , manufacture of  consumer electronics , and manufacture of electronic components and 
boards ). 
These figures illustrate that China is an important and growing counterpart in OECD import 
dependencies. But equivalent calculations for China suggest that OECD countries are an even more 
important counterpart for China.  
In the most recent periods , OECD c ountries as a whole accounted for approximately 70% of China’s 
import dependencies in ‘strategic’ products.  Japan and the United States are the two individual 
OECD countries which continue to account for the highest shares of China’s dependencies 
(respecti vely 15 and 1 2%). Nevertheless, the EU as group has become progressively more important 
and most recently accounted for 2 9%.  
Together with Germany, Italy, France and Sweden, the Netherlands is in the top -5 EU countries with 
highest shares of China’s impor t dependencies  in strategic products, accounting itself for 2% of them 
in 2020 -21. Other OECD countries accounted for an additional 14% of China’s dependencies in 
‘strategic’ products in that period.  
These high levels of China’s import dependency on OECD can be seen across most ‘strategic’ 
industries. The EU on its own accounts for more than 40% of China’s import dependencies in 
industries such as manufacture of motor vehicles , manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal 
chemical and botanical products , manu facture of bearings, gears, gearing and driving elements , 
manufacture of lifting and handling equipment , manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners . 
This list clearly includes several industries in which many OECD countries are also significantly 
dependent on China, which underscores the mutual character of these dependencies.

Possible implications of a reduced  trade between the OECD and  major non -OECD countries  
Assessing trade dependencies through scenario analysis  
Chapters 4 and 5 complement the picture of trade dependencies derived from the detailed trade data 
with two types of scenario analyses which use, respectively, the OECD ICIO tables combined with 
the so -called ‘hypothetical extraction’ methodology (hereafter ‘ICIO approach’) and the OECD global 
CGE trade model METRO (hereafter ‘CGE approach’).   
The principal trade reduction scenario considered in both approaches reduces all goods and services 
trade flows between each of the OECD  countries  and each of the MNOEs  by 10% (hereafter ‘trade 
reduction shock’ or ‘trade shock’). All the other trade flow s remain directly unaffected, but they can 
be affected indirectly, for example through interruption of indirect links involving OECD -MNOE trade 
if such links exist, or through redirection of trade and other economic adjustments. Wherever 
relevant, the resu lts of the principal scenario are also decomposed further to tease out the possible 
contributions to the principal trade shock scenarios of specific sectors and economie s where trade 
is being reduced (e.g. a reduction of trade between OECD countries and ju st China or Russia or just 
electronic products) . Note that this is a fairly stylised  trade reduction scenario and the estimated 
impacts should be interpreted as such.  
Albeit allowing for different levels of country and industry detail and putting different emphases on

  chain perspective  and capture not only those trade depen dencies that are due to direct import -export 
relationships but also those that may result from indirect trade links  (e.g. when a product exported 
from one country to another embeds a component produced in a third countr ies). Importantly, these 
methodologie s allow analysis of direct and indirect dependencies in the services sectors, which was 
not the case with the analysis of merchandise trade data in Chapter  3.  
The two approaches differ also in some important ways which helps shed light on different aspect s 
of trade dependencies. The ICIO approach assumes that prices are fixed and does not allow for any 
substitution , through trade or in domestic product and factor markets, to cushion the impacts of trade 
disruptions. It can  thus be thought of  as portraying short -term impacts which derive purely from GVC 
linkages, and which would dominate impacts when other  economic adjustments have not yet 
occurred. The CGE approach, while incorporating also the GVC linkages, accounts for typical 
adjustment mechanisms  to gau ge the impacts in the medium term  (typically thought to be five to ten 
years) . Modelling  adjustments in the sourcing of inputs, the re -balancing of intermediate and final 
product markets as well markets for different kinds of labour and capital, gives a mo re comprehensive 
picture of possible economic impacts.  
As expected, the magnitude and relative size of impacts differ somewhat between the two 
approaches due to their different assumptions, with the ICIO analysis producing generally larger 
impacts than th e CGE approach. There are however also several common findings.  
Overall, the results of these analyses confirm the high degree of trade interdependence of  the two 
groups of countries (and especially between OECD countries and China) and i llustrate some of  the 
economic costs that may be involved in the currently debated strategies of ‘de -risking’ supply chains.  
Most OECD and MNOE countries lose in the trade reduction scenario although there is a wide range 
in the extent of the economic impact.  
The most sign ificant specific findings of this analysis are summarised below.  
Impacts on OECD countries  
Most OECD countries  lose in the trade reduction scenario even if there is also a significant amount 
of inter -country variation and the estimated impacts depend on the modelling approach used.  
In the OECD countries , GDP declines range from 0.2 to 1.4% in the ICIO approach (Fi gure 8) and 
from nil to about 0.1% in the CGE approach.

Note: The aggregates OECD APAC, OECD Europe, OECD USMCA and OECD Other respectively refer to OECD countries that are part 
of the Asia -Pacific region, that are part of Europe, that are party to United States -Mexico -Canada Agreement, and to the remaining OECD 
countries.  
Source: OECD calculation s based on ICIO data.  
As expected, OECD countries and sectors with stronger trade linkages with MNOEs rather than the 
OECD fare worse while stronger linkages within the OECD help mitigate the impacts of the trade 
shock.  
In both approaches, OECD countries i n the Asia Pacific, in particular Korea and Australia, are 
affected the most  (GDP losses of , respectively, 1.4% and 1.2%  in the ICIO approach and , 0.08 and 
0.07% in the CGE approach). This is due to their  relatively strong intermediate  and final product 
linkages with MNOEs, particularly China , but also Indonesia and India. For example, Australia 
exports 77% of mining products and over a third of its metals to China. Similarly, half of Korean 
electronics and 45% of chemicals are exported to China.  Both these  countries also source relatively 
high portions of their intermediate inputs from China and other MNOEs.  
At the other end of the spectrum  are the  OECD countries of North America , with the United States 
losing only about 0.2% of GDP in the ICIO approach and  remaining largely unaffected in the CGE 
approach. This is explained by lower direct trade exposure s to MNOEs as well as the fact that the 
negative effects of reducing inputs from MNOEs are outweighed by market gains domestically and 
abroad, especially in markets of OECD partners who also cut supplies from MNOEs and where they 
are in a strong position to compete, including within the USMCA market . 
EU countries are somewhere in between. Among European countries, it is Germany and the 
Netherlands  that appear relatively  more exposed to the shock  (both lose about 0.6% of GDP in the 
ICIO approach and they lose 0.03 and 0.07% respectively in the CGE approach).  
Across the EU, exposure to trade with MNOEs appears relatively high in important manufacturing 
sectors, such as machinery , chemicals  and electronics , which experience the largest declines in 
value added. At the same time, some services industries with a cl ose connection to trade 
(e.g. transport and wholesaling) also tend to experience above -average declines in value added and 
this is important for economies such as that of the Netherlands where transport and logistical services 
are important contributors to  GDP and incomes . 
Indeed, it is noteworthy that the Netherland’s economy is relatively exposed not only across the 
manufacturing industries but also for several types of services which are affected directly or indirectly 
by the considered trade shock and w hich also account for significant shares of GDP ( e.g. legal 
services, IT services, wholesale trade and shipping and transport services).  For example, transport 

          23  
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  services are identified as one of the more affected sectors , which is explained by the fact that  the 
decline in world trade reduces the demand for shipping and transport services  and that the sector is 
a relatively important employer in the country.  
Across all OECD regions, the main driver of these GDP reductions is the decrease in trade with 
China,  even though some OECD countries have also noticeable exposures to other MNOEs. This is 
hardly surprising, given that China accounts for almost two -thirds of the MNOEs’ overall trade with 
the OECD.  
In the case of Europe, exposure to a disruption of trade with China is not as pronounced, but still 
significant. A 10% reduction in trade between the OECD countries and China is estimated  to reduce 
GDP in the EU27 by about 0. 3% in the ICIO approach and 0.04% in the CGE approach . However, 
the CGE approach shows t hat when trade links with MNOEs  are reduced , adjustments result in  intra-
EU trade fill ing some of  the gaps, and this cushions some of the negative effects.  In addition, several 
European countries (most notably  Poland) display ed non-negligible ties to the e conomy of Russia 
prior to its aggression on Ukraine .  
In the Netherlands, close to 70% of the negative impact of the trade shock is accounted for by trade 
with China. Across many Dutch industries it is the linkages with China that represent the main source  
of exposure ( e.g. postal and courier services, other utilities), but some Dutch industries also appear 
to have close links with Brazil (security services and rental services)  and some with Indonesia 
(shipbuilding, wood) . 
Impacts on MNOEs  
The considered trade shock is found to hurt the GDPs of some MNOE countries even more than 
those of OECD countries  (Figure 8) . This is because the export and import  links which are being 
disrupted in this scenario represent a larger share of the economy in MNO Es.  
Russia loses the most (1.7% in the ICIO approach and 0.1% in the CGE approach), followed by 
China (1% and 0.1%, respectively). India, South Africa, Indonesia and Brazil experience somewhat 
smaller losses (between 0.9 and 0.7% in the ICIO approach and between 0.07 and 0.02% in the 
CGE approach), although the loss rankings differ somewhat between the approaches.  
Different countries in the MNOE grouping have tighter trade linkages with different OECD regions 
and this determines the nature of their exposu re to the trade shock. South Africa is most dependent 
on OECD countries in Europe, whilst China, India and Brazil have comparatively stronger input and 
final product links with OECD countries in North America. For Indonesia, the key OECD partners are 
those  of the Asia Pacific. Russia’s dependency is due to its high reliance on trade with OECD 
countries in Europe prior to its aggression against Ukraine . 
Impacts across sectors and across different types of traded products  
In any given country, not all sector s of the economy are exposed to the considered trade shock to 
the same degree. The list of the most impacted industries varies from one country to another, but it 
is fairly common to find the highest levels of exposure in the primary sector and, more speci fically, in 
industries belonging to the mining and quarrying cluster. This is because the trade shock constrains 
several important flows of mineral resources between OECD and MNOEs. Australia, for example, 
sells more than four -fifths of its entire output o f metal ores directly to China and until recently many 
European countries relied heavily on Russia for their energy inputs. In addition, it is not uncommon 
for primary products to be indirectly re -exported as intermediate inputs embodied in other products.  
In several cases, the sectors identified as the most heavily dependent on OECD -MNOE trade, 
represent only small shares of their country’s economy. On the other hand, the list of highly impacted 
industries also includes those of great significance from bot h a domestic and a global point of view. 
Most notably, it includes the electronics  sector in Korea (where it is responsible for 7% of the 
country’s GDP), China (2.5%) and Japan (1.5%). In the same vein, a reduction of trade with OECD 
countries would also d o significant damage to India’s large IT services  sector which accounts for 
3.4% of the country’s GDP.  
24        
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  The results of the CGE analysis, which allows for market adjustments,  suggest also that impacts of 
the trade shock in some OECD manufacturing industries,  including electronics  but also textiles and 
wearing  apparel , can also be positive  in the medium term , while impacts on China and other MNOEs 
are negative  (Figure 9) . This is because some of the excess demand for these products is diverted 
towards the OECD  producers as a result of the trade shock. However, these sectoral output gains 
should be seen in the context of economy -wide effects which are negative for most OECD countries .

When a distinction is made between different destinations of traded products, China stands out in 
terms of the share of the impact accounted by the final demand channel (44% of the overall GDP 
impact). This means that more than for other countries, for China the dependence on trade with the 
OECD countries is mainly related to trade in final products and not inputs into production (either 
those that China itself uses for production or  those that it provides to other global producers). The 
trade shock  would have relatively severe repercussions for China ’s manufacturing production which 
is to a very significant degree destined for final consumers in the OECD  countries and draws 
significa ntly on OECD for inputs.

  For comparison, within the OECD, the weight of the final product component tends to be lower for 
the countries of the Asia Pacific region (25%) and higher in Europe (35% for the EU27) but is 
relatively low for the Netherlands (29%) . 
Conclusions and implications  
The results of this analysis illustrate some of the concerns that lie beneath the debate in on trade 
dependencies  in the context of increasingly uncertain global economic and geopolitical environments . 
As documented  in this report, global production of products has become increasingly concentrated, 
and it tends to be increasingly clustered around some countries and regi ons, notably China and Asia . 
This is not only due to natural or organic economic factors, such as natural endowments, comparative 
advantage, economies of scale , or GVC fragmentation, but also policies. Whichever is the principal 
source of growing concentra tion, shocks related to climate change , changes in economic policy or 
geopolitical conflicts, arguably have a higher potential to disrupt commercial links and caus e economic 
or societal damage  now than they had in the past. There is also more potential for trade to be used as 
a tool of economic coercion . 
Having said that, the evidence presented also shows that large, if not dominant, portions of global and 
national trade are relatively well div ersified overall, and that international product markets are 
characterised by a fair amount of competition and limited control over supply or price formation of 
specific importers or exporters. It is difficult to distinguish those concentrated trade links that could 
cause problems from advantageous trade linkages. C oncern s that policy responses which aim to 
minimise trade risks and improve supply chain resilience may not be well designed  and may  
unnecessarily undermine the benefits of international trade  are therefore legitimate.  
Countries  typically source their imports from  — and ship their exports to  — fewer partners than is in 
principle globally possible . This reflects a combination of natural factors, such as the role of geography 
and trade costs , but al so national  preferences and policies. There is thus untapped potential in using 
international markets to diversify. In fact, our findings suggest that a significant number of  OECD 
countries have been able to take advantage of diversification possibilities offered by international 
markets, as testified, for example , by declining average rates of import concentrations and bilateral 
import dependencies.  In this sense , trade dependency  does not seem to be a generalised 
phenomenon,  but it is rather confined to some specific countries and products . 
Which trading partners are the main counterparts in the highly concentrated trade linkages has indeed 
been raised as one of the key issues in the trade dependency  debate. This is a legitimate approach 
because geographic , economic  and geopolitical  risks are often related to the country  affiliation or 
location of trading partners. Here, too, some of our findings support a cautious approach to 
concentrated trade relations, while others are more reassuring . 
Dependency on China  has increased significantly across all OECD regions since the late 1990s  and 
the country  is now the single most important counterpart in trade dependencies of OECD as a whole 
and of several OECD countries  individually. There is thus interest in a better understanding  of the 
reasons for the emergence of China as a source of dependencies. In pa rticular, the contribution s of 
natural and policy -related factors, including policies which may have involved market distortions  or 
targeted non -economic objectives , need to be better understood .  
Trade dependencies of OECD economies on China also need to be put in the context of China’s 
dependencies on OECD. OECD as group —and several OECD countries  on their own —are a much  
more important counterpart s in dependencies of China . Moreover, China’s sectoral dependencies 
involving  OECD countries include several industries in which several OECD countries also depend 
on China, which signals the mutual character of some trade dependencies.  
The current debate on ‘de -risking’ international trade  needs to consider carefully  the possible  costs 
and benefits of different  policy choices . The different methodologies used to produce evidence 
unanimously demonstrate  a relatively high degree of trade interdependency  between the  OECD and 
MNOE countries  (and especially between OECD countries and C hina) as well as  potentially high 
economic costs of significant trade fragmentation.  OECD countries in Asia and Pacific come across 
as bearing the highest cost of fragmentation, followed by Europe (where Germany and the 
Netherlands are affected more than o n average), while OECD countries in North America record lower 
impacts. MNOEs , including China,  tend to be affected relatively more than the OECD.

  1. Introduction  
As a repercussion of some of the supply disruptions during the COVID -19 pandemic  and the Russia n 
Federation ’s (hereafter “Russia”) invasion of Ukraine , and in the context of growing geopolitical  and 
climatic  risks, there is a growing interest in identifying commercial  links that could cause high 
economic or societal damage  in case of unexpecte d disruptions , or those that could be used  as a 
tool of coercion or might create national security risks  or weigh on countries’ sovereignty . At the same 
time, t here is interest in making sure that policy responses designed to  minimis e trade risks and 
improv e supply chain resilience are well targeted and do not unnecessarily undermine  the benefits 
of international trade  enjoyed  by modern societies.  
Given the non -economic nature of many of the considerations  that seem to define  such  ‘trade 
dependencies’  in public debate , economic analysis is  clearly not the only  analytical approach that 
should be used  to unravel  them . Nevertheless,  economic analysis  can contribute an objective picture  
of global and national trade linkages, including  information  on their concentration, possibility of 
substitution  and overall economic importance . While t here is no on e methodological approach that 
would allow a reliable joint assessment of these criteria and an objective identification of such trade 
dependencies , a number of  different existing applied trade analysis methodologies  can be combined 
to filter out  at least some of  the potentially problematic trade links which  can be analysed further  from 
more multidisciplinary angles .  
This report has been commissioned b y the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Netherlands with a view 
of harnessing recent analytical work undertaken in this area at the OECD . The objective is to shed 
more empirical light on the question of  trade dependencies , not only in  the Netherlands  but also 
across the  wider  OECD membership as well as in Brazil, China, India , Indonesia, Russia  and South 
Africa ( which are hereafter referred to as major non -OECD economies, or MNOE13).  
The report  consists of a review of the emerging  economic  literature on trade dependencies 
(Chapter  2) as well an original empirical analysis  by the OECD Secretariat which uses some of the 
methodological approaches used recently in the literature to measur e trade dependencies . The 
empirical analysis includes , first, descriptive statistical analysis of  global trade data at a detailed 
product level through the lens of trade shares and trade concentration  ratios  which provide a broad 
overview of the possible extent, character and evolution of trade dependencies over the last decades  
(Chapter  3). Given the prominent role of some of the MNOEs in trade dependencies of OECD 
countries  as well as the current geopolitical context , an analysis of possible economic effects of a 
hypothetical scenario of reduced trade between  OECD countries and MNOEs  is conducted  using 
Inter-Country Input -Output techniques  and Trade in value Added (TiVA) data ( Chapter  4) and the 
OECD ’s computable general equilibrium  (CGE)  trade model METRO  (Chapter  4). While each of 
these approaches has its limitatio ns, combined they provide a relatively broad  economic perspective  
on the structure and economic importance of the potential trade dependencies. Chapter  5 concludes 
and outlines some preliminary policy implications.  
The current version of the document takes on board comments received following the presentation 
of the draft to the Working Party of the Trade Committee on 12 -13 December 2023. It is presented 
for declassification via written procedure.

  2. Literature review  
This Chapter  takes stock of the rapidly emerging literature on trade dependencies as seen from a 
public interest standpoint focusing in particular on: (i) methodologies used to identify trade 
dependencies and measure and assess their economic effects; (ii) the different definitions o f ‘critical’, 
‘essential’ and ‘strategic’ products; (iii) different categorisations of trading partners used in this 
context; (iv) profiles of shocks considered in this literature; and (v) key results and policy 
recommendations of these studies.  
2.1. Introducti on 
Analysis of trade concentration , diversification, or bottlenecks in supply chains, has long been a part 
of trade and trade policy analysis. Product and country diversification of trade , for example,  is often 
assessed  in economic development literature, particularly in the context of countries specialising in 
agricultural commodities and natural resources . Supply chain risks and resilience  have also been 
studied ., Such as  in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand 
in 2011. However , a mainstream surveillance of  potentially problematic trade linkages , with a view 
of identifying those that could cause economic or societal damage  when disrupted,  is a relatively 
new focus.  
Concerns about supply chain resilience  and disruptions in various international markets ( trade in 
goods, services, transport, movement of people) during the COVID -19 pandemic  and since Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine and  rising geopolitical tensions between m ajor economies  have restarted the  
debate on whether or not the world economy is  facing a period of ‘deglobalisation’, ‘friendshoring’, 
‘nearshoring’, creation of ‘trading blocks’ or ‘relocalisation’. Even though at the moment there is 
limited hard evidence  of such a large -scale fragmentation , a number of new policy initiatives and 
trade measures that are likely to contribute to fragmentation have been documented  (IMF, 2023 [1]).  
Trade linkages have long been known to involve  interdependence . Up until recently,  
interdependence was generally seen  in a positive light, principally involving mutually beneficial  
commercial exchanges , allowing better specialisation  and bringing higher productivity and access to 
a wider pool o f capabilities and ideas. However, recent global events disrupting international markets 
and supply chains have increased concerns about the supply chain resilience and the risks that might 
be transmitted through international trade linkages. Moreover, ris ing geopolitical tensions around the 
world bring additional concerns about what reductions to those trade linkages would mean for an 
economy . In this context, there is increase d interest in identifying trade linkages and dependencies 
which may have negativ e economic effects  if disrupted . 
Responding to the challenge of identifying  risks inherent in international trade therefore requires new 
ways of looking at the data and information, and a change in perception of certain empirical facts, 
mechanisms as well as assumptions underlying  economic analysis.  The related literature, which has 
emerged rapidly over the last few years, is therefore rather fragmented and unsettled.  
This chapter provides a review of selected recent contributions  organised along some of the common 
themes and issues addressed in these studies , including  the approaches  used  to defin e and measure 
‘trade dependencies’ and emerging policy recommendations.  
2.2. How can ‘vulnerable’, ‘critical’, ‘essential’ or ‘strategic’ products  be defined?  
The terms ‘vulnerable’, ‘strategic ’, ‘critical ’, ‘essential ’ are some of the  key concepts used by  policy 
makers when identifying products trade which may require government attention  or intervention 
(‘critical products ’ or ‘critical industries ’ thereafter  in this chapter ). These  attributes  can be evaluated 
both from an economic and form non-economic perspective s. From a non -economic perspective, 
these products  can be defined as  ones that are important for the wellbeing of the general public --for 
example in areas such as  national defen ce and security, public health, environmental and social 
protection, or a nation’s food system. From an economic perspective, critical products or industr ies 
can be usefully defined as ones which are crucial input s into a wide range of economically important 
28        
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  domestic industries and whose supply failures would have  negative impact s across the national 
economy  or is a significant source of national income . The assessment could consider both current 
requirements as well as  projected future needs  (e.g. products required for the green transition ) 
(Schwellnus, Haramboure and Samek, 2023 [2]).  
Products or industries identified as critical are those which are not only vulnerable to global supply 
chain disruptions but also economically  important enough to require increased  monitoring. Identifying 
a product or supply chain  as ‘criti cal’ from an economic point of view can involve either  qualitative or 
quantitative analysis but it generally combines three criteria: 1) economic importance ; 2) probability 
of disruption  or supply risk ; 3) and the ability to find alternative sources (Figur e 2.1).  
Figure  2.1. Critical dependency criteria  
 
Source: Authors’ compilation . 
Identification  of economically important products often involves two stages. First, studies tend 
examine to what extent a specific imported product is used in the production process of domestic 
industries, and then whether those industries themselves are important natio nal industries. In some 
cases, an additional criterion is added which considers whether the absence of the product would 
cause detrimental harm to the economy. This last consideration requires consultation with industry 
experts.  
For economically important national industries, a disruption in their supply could have economy wide 
repercussions.  These disruptions can occur in different countries or geographical locations . They 
can have different sources (political, geographical, natural) and they may concern specific products 
or wide ranges of products.  The higher the probability of disruptions , the higher the supply risk,  the 
higher the degree of criticality.  However, the risk of supply disruption  can be alleviated if there are 
alternative sources fou nd among trading partners  (or among alternative types of products). The less 
diversified and more concentrated the import sources the less feasible is the ability find alternatives 
suppliers which increases the degree of criticality.  
This is a useful conc eptual distinction of the different characteristics  that may underpin criticality even 
if some of the measures that are used to quantify them in analytical work, such as for example trade 
shares, may be imperfect indicators of these characteristics or may be capturing more than one of 
them.14  
 
 
14 For example, trade shares have been used in the literature to capture both the extent of risk , but also the 
flexibility of supplier diversification in the face of shocks (see  discussion below).

  2.2.1. How are the different dependency criteria  combined and measured ? 
Studies and methodologies trying to identify critical dependencies often take into consideration at 
least the economic importance  and potential for supp ly risk of a product . Identifying products that are 
of economic importance includes an assessment of the extent to which product is used as an input 
in domestic industries and how import those industries are to the national economy , ideally using 
data on n ational production and the inputs to the production process distinguishing imported and 
domestically source goods at a highly detailed level.  
Countries  have long been identifying critical minerals and raw materials with potential for supply 
disruptions , such that the necessary information on raw material use in specific industries are 
available to determine economic importance of specific raw materials . The EU (European 
Commission, 2017 [3]) as well as United States (2020 [4]) (2021 [5]) use economic importance as one 
criterion in compiling their lists, which is measured as the share of a raw material ’s end use in a 
sector15 weighted  by the share of that sector’s value added  in the total value added of the economy . 
Several country specific analyses , Flach et  al. (2021 [6]) and Baur , Flach (2022 [7]) and Productivity 
Commission  (2021 [8]), expand ed the identification  of economically important products beyond raw 
materials to include all goods . While trade data is available to identify sources of imported inputs at 
a fairly detailed level16, data on industry use and production  at a similar granular level is often 
unavailable , and studies have to find alternative sources for this information.  Flach et  al. (2021 [6]) 
and Baur, Flach (2022 [7]) used a combination of GTAP data17--a global database which includes 
country level production in 65 different  goods and services industries —to identif y the Germany’s top 
five goods sectors18 and US Census Bureau Input -Output tables , which  include  data on  almost 500 
products  and the inputs into their production processes . The combined the two databases together 
to identi fy the top three inputs for the top five goods sectors .19 Similarly,  Australia’s Productivity 
Commission (2021 [8]) mapped products  found to be vulnerable to foreign supply disruptions that were 
identified using analyses on detailed trade data  to Australia’s Input -Output tables containing 
information on 114 industry and product groups .20 While Flach et  al. (2021 [6]) and Baur, Flach 
(2022 [7]) used the GTAP database  to identify economically important sectors, the Productivity 
Commission used a list21 of 25 I -O sectors deemed essential  to meet ing the needs of Australians . 
They then  identified  the inputs into those essential sectors  which were vulnerable to disruptions .

  vulnerable Canadian imports at the HS 6 digit  to intermediate and capital goods assuming these 
categories pose a larger risk to supply chain disruptions than final consumer goods.  
Some studies use network analysis , a field of study analysing how entities  are connected and behave 
in complex system s, to characterize supply networks and identify those that are more vulnerable to 
disruptions.  Bonneau and Nakaa  (2020 [10]), when identifying critical products for France , included a 
metric to identify networks with a limited n umber of suppliers in highly concentrated supply network  
using a centrality measure based on  (Korniyenko, Pinat and Dew, 2017 [11]).  
Korniyenko, Pinat and Dew  (2017 [11]) used the concept s of centrality and clustering to characterize 
the supplier network and  asses s the exposure of a country’s import basket to trade disruptions . First,  
the authors looked for the presence of central players by examin ing the importance of each exporter 
as a supplier of a product to each importing country measured as the share of total imports of the 
product. If the standard deviation of the shares is high, then there are likely  a few exporters who are 
playing a central ro le in the trade network of the product adding to a product ’s vulnerability. 
Additionally, if the trade network has many clusters,  groups of countries trading the same product 
more among st each other than the rest of the world , the more difficult it will be  for an importer to find 
alternative suppliers in case of a supply shock  that occurs within the group .  
Other methods of characterizing trade linkages and identifying vulnerably products include using 
trade data to measure the exposure of imports to external supply shocks.  Measures of product 
exposure look at the concentrat ion of imports into a country and the concentrat ion of the global export 
markets. The heav ier the r eliance on a few suppliers of product in a market with limited number of 
suppliers  the more vulnerable the product is to a supply risk. Market concentrations if often measured 
using the Herfindahl -Hirschman Index  ( (Nassar and Fortier, 2021 [5]), (Nassar et  al., 2020 [4]), (Braun 
et al., 2023 [12]), (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]), (Productivit y Commission, 2021 [8])) (HHI thereafter) . The 
higher the index the more imports are concentrated on a small number of trading partner countries  
(see Chapter  3 for a more detailed discussion of the interpretation of the values of the HHI)22. 
Alternatively,  the Australian Productivity Commission (2021 [8]) considered products vulnerable to 
supply shocks if a single supplier account s for over 80% of the imports as being a highly 
concentrated. They considered this  criterion as the actual risk, while the global market concentration  
criterion a s the potential supply risk.  
Supply risk can be attenuated if substitutes for the disrupted import supply can be found. S ome 
studies  included  in the assessment of criticality  a measure of the ability to replace imports by 
domestic production in case of a supply shock  (European Commission, 2021 [13]), (Vicard and 
Wibaux, 2023 [14]), (Baur and F lach, 2022 [7]), (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]). For the se studies that use the EU 
bottom -up approach  to identify foreign dependencies , total EU exports are used as a proxy for EU 
production since domestic production is not avail able at a detailed level studies . Products  are 
considered vulnerable when the imports from extra -EU regions are greater than EU total exports 
(European Commission, 2021 [13]) otherwise , it is assumed,  imports could be repl aced by production 
and supply risk is reduced. A similar approach, using exports as proxy for domestic production, is 
used in identifying vulnerable Canadian  imports (Jiang, 2021 [9]). 
Similarly, if there is a readily available alternative material that could be used in the manufacturing 
process, th en the criticality of the dependency may be  reduced  because the risk of supply disruption  
is reduced . The US approach in compiling their list of critical raw minerals include s a general 
assess ment of  the industry ’s ability to cope with disruptions measured as the industry’s expenditure  
on the commodity relative to its operating profits. Industries with limited profits and greater 
expenditure on a commodity have less flexibilit y to deal with a supply disruption (Nassar and Fortier, 
 
 
22 Most studies provide a qualitative rationale for threshold selection rather than a statistical basi s for determining 
the thresholds. As far as measure of trade exposure are concerned, for example, the threshold is often “>0.5”, 
meaning that foreign sources account for more than half of consumption. This has an intuitive appeal, but, as 
we show in Chapte r 3, trade links where a specific partner accounts for more than half of all imports of a product 
are relatively few. Using different thresholds clearly affects the results obtained which suggests the need for 
sensitivity analysis using different threshold s to formulate robust qualitative implications.

  2021 [5]).23 The European Commission  includes a substitutability index in their supply risk assessment 
of critical minerals (European Commission, 2017 [3]) which includes  the possibility of alternative 
sources of a raw material such as recycling . Korniyenko, Pinat and Dew  (2017 [11]) also include a 
product substitutabil ity metric in their assessment of vulnerable product networks at the HS 6-digit 
level taking into account  the variation in human capital intensity across exporters to determine if 
products were substitutable.  High variation of human capital intensity, indicates lower likelihood of 
being substitutable as inputs into production.   
Some studies incorporate  non-economic risk characteristics into their assessment of the foreign 
reliance. For example, researchers  at the US Geological survey, tasked on producing and reviewing 
the US critical minerals list every three years, included both suppliers ’ ability to supply but also their 
willingness to  supply to the United States to measure the likelihood of foreign supply disruption 
(Nassar and Fortier, 2021 [5]), (Nassar et  al., 2020 [4]). The ability  to supply is based on the exporter’s 
country profile24 including political stability, labor availability, infrastructure quality, trade regulations 
among others. The exporter’s willingness to supply is a composite of three different indicators: 
1) importance of US trade ties, a countries ’ share of trade with the US as a share of their GDP; 
2) shared values with the US, which is the distance between Freedom House measures of political 
rights and civil liberties.; and 3) if there is a current collective military arrangement with the US. The 
EU methodology for id entify ing critical raw materials uses  a similar approach (European 
Commission, 2017 [3]) where their supply risk assessment also  incorporates non -economic factors 
such as political instability, government effectiveness and corrup tion using a Governance Index.  
Similarly, i n their assessment of dependencies in Germany’s foreign supply chain, Flach et  al., 
(2021 [6]) combined  their findings on product dependencies with risk indicators of different types of 
risk to discuss the likelihood that a product is at risk based on the risk indicators of its main supplier. 
The authors examine four risk indicators: economic policy uncerta inty; geopolitical  risk; climate 
change risk; and cybersecurity risk25 which are available at the country level. Subsequently, s uppliers 
in the bilateral trade data of the dependent product are each assigned their level of risk  (the 
normalized risk indices ), and a 5 -tier ranking is produced for each risk type based on quintiles (very 
low, low, medium, high, very high)  for each risk category . The authors then assessed each critical 
dependency in the context of the “riskiness” of the main suppliers of each pr oduct to determine if the 
risk was critical or not. For example, t he study found that, although there is a high degree of foreign 
dependence for lactams  (chemical substances  used in the production of medicines ) they were not 
considered critical because they sourced from comparatively “safe” trading partners in terms of each 
of the four  considered  risk types . 
Studies previous ly referenced  in this section identify vulnerabilites by first identifying products critical 
products with the pontential for disruption and  then identify the source , however s ome studies first 
identify potential sources of supply disruptions and then find countries and sectors most ex posed 
based on the characteristics of the product supply network. For exaple, Braun et  al. (2023 [12]) first 
identified critical products where a disruption from Russia or Ukraine could expose countries to 
disruptions in trade  by identifying the  products where Russia or Ukraine are important  suppliers 
based total export values or revealed  comparative advantage (RCA)  indices26. Among t he products 
where the two countries have RCA , the autho rs selected those w here many regions depend on 
imports of the product from these two countries and where therefore substitution may be more 
constrained in the face of shocks.  
 
 
23 These authors argue that the expenditure on commodity as a share of profit combines both the importance of 
the commodity in the industry and the industry’s ability to find substitutes in the event of a supp ly disruption.  
24 Produced by the Fraser Institute Annual Survey of Mining Companies 2020 . 
25 The risk indicators are either published by an organisation or based on a methodology found in the literature.  
All indictors are based on a multi -year average, except for the Cybersecurity Risk indicator , which is onl y 
available for 2020, and are normalised to have values between 0 -1.  
26 RCA indices  intend to measure a country’s relative ability to produce the good relative to other goods and 
regions because of its underlying productivity or resource endowments , i.e. t heir comparative advantage.

  It is noteworthy that most  existing studies on critical dependencies focus on the  risk of a supply 
disruption  examining foreign  supplier reliance, import dependencies, and the ability to find  alternative 
suppliers . and this is reflected in this literature review . As discussed in Chapter  3, this may be 
explained by the fact that concentration of exports of products across supplying countries tends to 
be higher than the concentration of imports across importing countries. However, in principle some 
countries may be relatively heavily relia nt on exports and similar analys es may be warranted from  
the perspective of the demand side  and the risk to domestic suppliers . For example, China being the 
largest market for semi -conductor was noted as a supply chain risk  in the White House 100 Day 
Suppl y Chain report (The White House, 2021 [15]). Australia’s Productivity Commission assessed their 
domestic sectors vulnerabilities to both disruptions in foreign supply of inputs as well as external 
markets for exported products  as some export sectors are important sources of national income and 
disruptions to the export markets could have consequential effects on national wellbeing (Productivity 
Commission, 2021 [8]).  
2.2.2. How  are trading partners  categori sed? 
The probability of some disruptions  may be determined  — or strongly influenced  — by the country 
location or affiliation of suppliers . This is why  most existing analyses of trade dependencies make 
some kind of differentiation among the different partner countries . While often closely intertwined 
with each other, the three types of supply risk which are correlated with the country affiliation or 
location can be broadly categori sed as geographic, economic  or geopolitical.  Geopolitical risks  in 
particular  — defined broadly as those related to political power attached to  geographic  space  
(territorial waters, land territory and other natural resourc es) — have  recently attracted much 
attention in the context of growing geopolitical  tensions.  
In the context of the EU Members in particular , the geographic, economic and geopolitical proximity 
is so high that it is logical to only consider non-EU partne rs as potential sources of risk  and several 
studies make  such a delineation . It has to be  mentioned,  however , that, albeit at a different leve l, the 
structure of trade interdependenc ies within the EU as well as heterogeneity (both across products 
and across partners) across the EU membership  vis-à-vis external partners are also relevant  for 
policy.  First, it is of an internal interest to understand differences in exposures to possible supply 
disruptions within the EU to make sure  that, if needed,  the necessary micro - and macro economic 
adjustments can be supported by appropriate policies . Second, d ifferent EU Members may be 
exposed differen tly to different external geopolitical risks  and pressures . 
In the aftermath of the COVID -19 pandemic, and in the context of global geopolitical divisions that 
have been emerging before  — and deepened after  — Russia’s invasion  of Ukraine,  several papers 
have looked  into the economic impact s of possible  “friendshoring”  or “geopo litical fragmentation ” 
scenarios , whereby the existing trade links would  reconfigured through  trade and trade -related  
policies so as to encourage trade between  ‘friendly’  or ‘like-minded’ trading partners  and to limit trade 
vis-à-vis geopolitical rivals. In this context,  several  studies consider ed different fragmentation 
scenarios leading to a polarised world economy, in particular different versions of  a two-polar world, 
with a set of countries aligning themselves with the United States and European Union and another 
with closer relations to China.  
Bolhuis, Chen and Kett  (2023 [16]) aimed to quanti fy the economic cost of trade fragmentation of 
commodities  by considering various scenarios where countries align themselves with the US and the 
or China by imposing trade barriers  on China and vice versa , where the alignment is based on  while 
the other countries economically realign themselves with one of these two blocks based on historical 
trade ties : countries who have traded more with the US were  categorised into one group while those 
with closer ties to China were  categorised into the other group . An alternative scenario was also 
considered where countries  were assigned into the US -centred and China -centred blocks based on 
          33  
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  an objective measure of political distance  between countries, based on the historical voting behaviour 
of countri es in the UN General, i.e. the so -called Ideal Point Estimate (IDP)27 between two countries.   
The same IDP measure was also used in a study of geopolitical fragmentation of the international 
trade by the WTO (2022 [17]) as well as of geopolitical fragmentation  of foreign direct investment (IMF, 
2023 [18]). The study by the (IMF, 2023 [18]) categorised countries into five groups based on their 
distance from the US using quantiles to form five equal groups those very close to the US, close, 
medium distance, far, and very far.  
Existing s tudies looking into the economic impact of Russia tend to  explicitly group the countries 
politically based on their stance on the war or the sanctions ( (Arriola et  al., 2023 [19]), (Chepeliev, 
Hertel and van der Mensbrugghe, 202 2[20]), (Rose, Chen and Wei, 2022 [21])). The studies referenced 
in this paper that look into the impact of Russia ’s war against Ukraine and subsequent oil ban and 
sanctions had very similar country groupings. The studies looking into sanction  grouped countries 
into those sanctioning Russia versus those did not. Moreover, the studies that focused on energy 
(Arriola et  al., 2023 [19]), (Chepeliev, Hertel and van der Mensbrugghe, 2022 [20]) as well as non -energy 
(Rose, Chen and Wei, 202 2[21]) commodities included  countries  or regions that were both main 
producers or consumers each commodity.  
2.2.3. What types of shocks are considered?  
Disruptions in the global economy have many characteristics which filter through into the analysis of 
those disruptions. Within the literature, different types of shocks are examined, including supply and 
demand, sector -specific  or economy -wide, and specific to supply chains or goods versus services, 
depending on the specific effects that researchers aim to analy se.  
Grassia et  al. (2022 [22]) focused on shocks to domestic  food production in order to analyse how 
shocks in food product s propagate to other countries and if access to in ternational markets help s to 
mitigate the negative effects. Similarly, Arnold et  al., (2023 [23]) focused on global supply chains of the 
mining sector. This analysis used a CGE model and shocked production in the mining, meta ls, motor 
vehicles sector each region of the model to assess the exposure of the mining sector in Latin 
America. While Arriola et  al. (2020 [24]) and Schwellnus, Haramboure and Samek  (2023 [2]) looked at 
reduced supplies to international markets across all sectors in all regions, much like the effects seen 
in 2019 due to the COVDI -19 pandemic.  Jiang and Scarffe (2021 [25]) examined vulnerabilities of 
Canadian imports and exports to logistic disruptions creating vulnerability indices by modes of 
transportation as well as Canadian port of entry and exit.  
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has prompted research on the impact of the war and 
sanctions on the global economy. The war itself has disrupted  trade on products for which Russia or 
Ukraine are important global suppliers.  Rose, Chen and Wei (2022 [21]) examined the impact of 
reduced exports of agricultur al commodities, minerals and metals. While several studies looked into 
the Russian oil ban, which reduced demand of Russian oil by a set of countries (  (Arriola et  al., 
2023 [19]); (Chepeliev, Hertel and van der Mensbrugghe, 2022 [20])). Arriola et  al. (2023 [19]) included 
an Input -Output and CGE analysis to analyse a hypothetical decline in trade with Russia on all 
sectors due to sanctions put in place by a set of countries. Moreover, the CGE analysis decomposed 
the shocks to be able to compare shocks on goods versus servic es and sanctions on exports to 
Russia versus imports from Russia. The study found that restrictions on exports of goods and 
services to Russia adds at least as much economic pressure as oil sanctions.  
As researchers think ahead on the future of global val ue chains , the distinction between  goods versus 
services  may become more important. Baldwin and Freeman  (2022 [26]) point out th at digital 
technology (digitech) and artificial intelligence (AI) will change the landscape of global supply chains. 
 
 
27 Bailey, Strezhnev and Voeten (2016 [52]) used  observed voting behaviour during the United Nations General 
Assembly  the authors estimated the ideal point estimate which represents the policy or ideological position of a 
country from which they produced bilateral geopolitical distance between two countries.

  For one thing, if labour -cost shares in manufacturing fall but the separation costs (the additional  cost 
of extra coordination, communicati on, and trade costs that separation entails ) do not fall as much, 
then they expect firms to reduce global supply chain trade and produce more stages locally. This 
outcome would be the result of long -term trends in industrial automation and of the fact that  most 
non-labour costs are trade costs.  Moreover, they argue that digital technology will make services 
more tradeable. As result “t he future of international supply chain trade lies increasingly in services 
and decreasingly in goods ” (Baldwin and Freeman, 2022 [26]). 
2.3. Overview of m ethodologies used to define trade dependencies and assess their economic 
effects  
Economic s tudies on trade dependencies and vulnerabilities use a range of methodologies and 
frameworks. For a comprehensive assessment of supply risks and their impact on manufacturing  
industries, granular data  allow s for a more th orough and realistic assessment. Ag gregated data can 
mask vulnerabilities associated with producing and trading product s. For example,  according to the 
ITC Trade Map database28, while the top five exporters of Electrical machinery (HS code 85) 
accounted for just over half of all exports in 2022, the concentration of light emitting diodes supplies, 
also known as LEDs (HS8541.41) was even higher, with the top five exporters accounting for almost 
80% of the market. However, relying solely on granular trade data does not capture the direct trade -
production  (or ‘input -output’)  linkages which may underestimate dependencies and exposure of 
national industries. Furthermore, gross trade does not capture vulnerabilities from indirect linkages 
embedded in global supply chains where, for example , computer monitors produced in South Korea 
may indirectly depend on copper production in Chile that is used to produce the wiring of the LEDs 
from China used in the South Korean computer monitors. Due to limitations of a single methodology , 
studies often us e a mix of methodologies or find innovative ways to address these limitations.   
Trade dependency analysis  can be characterized  as falling under four types of methodologies. Each  
approach has strengths and limitations. By employing a combination of methods,  the analysis can 
gain from the strengths of each approach.  
2.3.1. First approach: Using g ranular data to identify critical products  
Using granular data has the advantage of allowing for more precise analysis of dependencies and 
vulnerabilities  allowing policy  makers to make targeted decision about the response required.  Studies 
using this approach  use detailed gross trade data to measure supply risk, often with network analysis 
(concentration and centrality of suppliers) to determine a country or sector’s expo sure to supply 
disruptions ( (Bonneau and Nakaa, 2020 [10]), (Korniyenko, Pinat and Dew, 2017 [11]), (Braun et  al., 
2023 [12]), (Baur and Flach, 2022 [7]), (European Commission, 2021 [13]), (Productivity Commission, 
2021 [8])). In some cases,  supply risk assessments includes metrics beyond the characteristics  of the 
supply  network , like  a partner’s ability or willingness to supply  ( (European Commission, 2017 [3]), 
(Nassar and Fortier, 2021 [5]), (Nassar et  al., 2020 [4])) or a partner’s susceptibility to non -economic 
risks such as  climate change or cyber attacks (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]). This is also the approach 
followed in this study’s Chapter  3. 
(Bonneau and Nakaa, 2020 [10]) studied t rade data at the detailed, HS 6 -digit level, combined with 
network analysis concepts of concentration and centrality to identify products that have high potential 
for foreign supply disruption  that is those that are characterized by heavy reliance on foreign sources 
for a product with only a few main suppliers. Korniyenko, Pinat and Dew  (2017 [11]) used a similar 
approac h and argued that finding alternative suppliers increase s in difficulty if regions trade within 
different clusters or the products across different exporters (even at the HS6 level) are not

OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  substitutable29. The granular data approach was also used by Braun  et al. (2023 [12]) to identify regions 
exposed to  imports from  Russia or Ukraine  first identified products where the two countries played 
important and central roles as exporters.  
The European Co mmission (2021 [13]) also used granular data in their “bottom -up” approach to 
identify products to monitor in the context of their review of strategic dependencies . These  were 
identifie d as products with high foreign ( extra -EU) reliance on a concentrated set of non -EU exporters 
which could not be substituted with EU production. Since production data was not available at this 
granular level, intra-EU imports  were used as a proxy. Vicard and Wibaux (2023 [14]) use granular 
trade data and the EU bottom -up methodology to analyse how EU -27 trade dependencies have 
evolved over time.  
In studying Germany’s global value chains, Flach et  al., (2021 [6]) used a database at a somewhat 
aggregated  level to get information about the country’s sectoral production and linked it with a more 
detailed input -output table of over 500 products describing inputs into production of its most important 
industries . The authors selected the top 5 inputs for each economically important products and then 
evaluated  Germany’s dependency on foreign suppliers  by identifying the corresponding HS 6 -digit 
code for each input . The authors included an evaluation of the risk exposure of suppliers to various 
types of risks, both economic and non -economic.  
The Australian Productivity Commission (2021 [8]) produced a framework they deemed “data -with-
experts” and applied it Aust ralia’s exports and imports in  order to identify supply and products that 
critical to the Australian Eco nomy and wellbeing of its citizens  which are vulnerable to disruptions  
lasting 6 months . The approach is similar to the EU’s “bottom -up” methodology.  Using highly detailed, 
HS 8 -digit level data, on Australian imports, the authors identified products where  a single exporter 
accounted for at least 80% of the imports into the country and where the exporter market had a limited 
number of alternative suppliers (HHI based on HS -6 digit data above a certain threshold).  The authors 
then identified which of these v ulnerable products are used in the sectors considered essential by 
mapping the products from the trade data to the inputs in the Australian I -O table.  Last step, not 
actualised in the report, would be to consult with industry experts to identify those that  are critical 
because readily available substitutes do not yet exist.  
The minerals sector is one industry where there is data on both production and trade at the granular 
level. This sector is often considered  strategic and therefore data available is often not an issue . 
Examples of studies of dependencies on critical raw materials using this approach include  (European 
Commission, 2017 [3]), (Nassar and Fortier, 2021 [5]), (Nassar et  al., 2020 [4])). 
2.3.2. Second approach: Input -Output data to measure  dependencies through global value 
chains  
A second method is to measure exposure using  the traditional input -output data which captures input 
linkages  and output allocation to better capture supply and demand dependencies as well as indirect 
linkages  (Ayadi et  al., 2021 [27]), (Baldwin and Freeman, 2022 [26]), (Schwellnus et  al., 2023 [28]), 
(Schwellnus et  al., 2023 [28])), (Inomata and Hanaka, 2021 [29])). Using Input -Output data in principle 
captures the exposure to the entire global supply chain. This is also the approach followed in this 
study’s Chapter  4. 
Using a Multi-Region Input-Output  database , Ayadi (2021 [27]) measured supply and demand side 
exposure for a set of Mediterranean countries. The authors compute GVC indicators that describe a 
countries exposure on both the demand side (as a supplier or demander of Value Added for exports) 
as well as the supply side (as the ultimate destination of VA). Baldwin and Freeman  (2022 [26]) 
produced similar metrics: a Foreign Input Reliance (FIR) Index which measures countries' total 
 
 
29 If there is a high variation of human capital intensity, there is a high likely hood that production methods are 
different and have lower likelihood of being substitutable as inputs into the different production process across 
the regions (Korniyenko, Pinat and Dew, 2017 [11]). 
36        
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  reliance on foreign production on the sourcing side; and Foreign  market reliance (FMR) index which 
measures countries’ reliance on foreign markets on the sales side. They added that measure ments 
could  be based on value added or gross output. Using gross trade and gross output rather than value 
added, would account for the fact that longer supply chains may involve a higher risk of disruption 
since using gross trade adds the same value added each time a product moves across borders as it 
moves through production stages.  Schwellnus et  al. (2023 [28]) produced the FMR and FIR indicators 
using the OECD input -output database as well as two indictors that cap ture whether a region -sector 
is a potential choke point in the value chain either upstream (average FIR across buying sector -
country)  or downstream (average FMR across given supplying sector -country).   
As a complement to these standard volume or value based methods of measuring exposure to supply 
chain disruptions, Inomata and Hanaka  (2021 [29]) measured exposure  to risk as the frequency  of 
engagem ent with foreign industrial sectors. They compute d a pass -through frequency (PTF) indicator 
that represents the average number of times a particular supply chain passes through a target sector 
in a given production system. They argue d that a frequency meas ure relates to “probability” aspect of 
supply chain risk and could complement conventional methods.   
2.3.3. Third approach: Modelling approaches to measure exposure to shocks  
A third method of measuring exposure utili ses modelling frameworks to measure a country’ s exposure 
to shocks across all or specific sectors (Grassia et  al., 2022 [22]); (Arriola et  al., 2020 [24]); (Arriola et  al., 
2023 [19]), (Chepeliev, Hertel and van der Mensbrugghe, 2022 [20]); (Rose, Chen and Wei, 2022 [21]). The 
principal interest  in using models  is that  they incorporate behavioral responses and subsequent 
adjustments . This is also the approach followed in this study’s Chapter  5. 
The Netherland Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis in conjunction  with Statistics Netherland s studied 
China's economic interwovenness with the EU and the Netherland s using a combination of 
approaches (2022 [30]). Using an international input output analysis with a nonlinear optimization 
framewor k to allow for industry response , they measure d the degree of Dutch -China dependency  
using a potential impact factor (PIF) which measures the change in gross production (output) of an 
industry relative to the size of the shock ― which was  a 25% reduction i n trade between the EU 
Members and China. The authors also used a gravity model to assess the economic benefit of lowering 
import tariffs by increasing the tariffs to 1990 levels (25 ppt higher than current situation in both 
directions).   
Grassia et al. (2022 [22]), Arnold et al. (2023 [23]) and Arriola, Kowalski and van Tongeren  
(forthcoming [31]) employed similar methodologies but using different modelling approaches to assess 
regions' exposure to idiosyncrtic production shocks. Grassia et  al (2022 [22]) used bilateral trade and 
production data of food in a shocks diffusion model to measure regions exposure to food production 
shocks. The authors reduced food production in each region in the model where the directly impacted 
countries adjust  exports or imports  to try and eliminate the demand deficit. This  adjust would result in 
demand deficits in partner  countries , who  then respond by reducing their exports. The shock diffusion 
stops when no country facing a positive demand deficit can further reduce its exports to try to meet 
domestic food demand.  A count ry’s exposure  to food shocks is the average food demand deficit 
induced by each shock. A similar approach on a broader set of sectors was applied using a global 
CGE model to identify regions and sectors exposed in Latin America to supply disruptions in the 
mining, steel and motor vehicle industries (Arnold et  al., 2023 [23]). Authors simulated positive and 
negative production shocks in each of the three sectors, one sector at time in one region at time. The 
extent of exposure of a national industry to these three industries was by a ‘maximum negative 
exposure’ measure, which is the total decline in production if all shocks negatively impacting the sector 
were to happen concurrently. One advantage of using a CGE model to measure ex posure is the 
inclusion relative price effects as well as economy linkages that allows sectoral production and 
consumption to change as part of a country’s response . 
Recent  global events have highlighted sector - and country exposures to disruptions in supp ly chains. 
Most recently, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has spurred tense analysis on regions’ 
exposure to commodities trade with both Russia and to some extent Ukraine. Braun et  al. (2023 [12]) 
found that many regions were exposed to Russian energy and food commodities, particularly wheat, 
          37  
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  trade with the two countries.  Accordingly, several studies were produced analysing the e conomic 
impact of sanctions on Russian energy  using a CGE model (Chepeliev, Hertel and van der 
Mensbrugghe, 2022 [20]) and of major disruptions of exports of grains and metals (Rose, Chen and Wei, 
2022 [21]) commodities markets because of war. Global CGE models capture medium run impacts of 
the disruptions to the economy since they include both general equilibrium effects as well as economy 
wide linkag es between sectors, between regions and between supply and demand. To measure 
overall economic impact of the disruption , both studies use GDP or real household income changes 
when assessing the overall impact. In addition to examining the macroeconomic imp act of sanctions, 
Arriola et al. (2023 [19]), used both Input -Output analysis as well as a global CGE model to measure a 
region and sectors exposure to Russian sanctions . Using both an Input -Output analysis and a CGE  
analysis gives the ability to decompose the short -term effect  of the oil sanctions with the medium run 
affect after all markets adjust, although the two approaches often use different sources of data which 
complicates co mparison of results .  
2.3.4. Fourth approach: Case studies and surveys for in -depth reviews  
Lastly, while the data driven approach to measuring trade dependencies and exposure to shocks is 
transparent and allows for targeted policy measures, the complexity of the market, length of the  supply 
chain, or lack of available data require additional types of analyses to provide further insights to policy 
makers. Incorporating  insights from industry experts and stakeholders complement s data analysis to 
provide an even deeper analysis of the ri sks and linkages that make a product critical or economically 
important . 
In depth reviews and case studies have indeed been used to provide a richer analysis at the granular 
level once a dependent product has been identified (  (European Commission, 2021 [13]), (European 
Commission, 2022 [32]), (The White House, 2021 [15])). And firm level surveys have  offered a deeper 
understanding of firms strategies for addressing dependencies and risks  (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]) and 
(Baur and Flach, 2022 [7])). A number of in -depth studies on interdependencies incorporate d one or 
more of these methodologies to account for the limitations of an individual  approach (  (Flach et  al., 
2021 [6]), (CPB, 2022 [30]), (Arriola et  al., 2023 [19])). 
For example, t he European Commission us ed the granular data approach as a first step in identifying 
vulnerable products (European Commission, 2021 [13]). Once a product was identified as vulnerable, 
an in -depth review  is undertaken  calling on industry experts and stakeholders to provide  additional 
market insight for each product to help identify critical products in strategic sectors. Products in six 
select ed strategic areas were reviewed: Raw materials; Active pharmaceutical ingredients ; Li-ion 
batteries; Hydrogen; Semiconductors; and Cloud and Edge Computing. An even deeper review 
followed on raw and pro cessed  materials, chemicals, cloud and edge services as well as photovoltaic 
panels , and cybersecurity as part of the second stage of the review  (European Commission, 2022 [32]). 
Similarly, the United States government called for their own comprehensive review of critical US 
supply chains considered important to the economy (The White House, 2021 [15]). There was much 
overlap with the European list of cri tical sectors: semiconductors manufacturing and advanced 
packaging; large  capacity batteries; critical minerals and materials; and pharmaceuticals and active 
pharmaceutical ingredients.  
Two studies from the same instutite u sed on -line firm level surveys to get more insights on firms’ 
strategies  related  to the supply chain risks and dependencies  in general and with respect to their 
import relationship with China. Flach et  al. (2021 [6]) asked 5 000  firms in the manufacturing and service 
industries about procurement strategies  including finding suppliers closer to home . Baur and Flach  
(2022 [7]) used the surveys to get more insight on firms ’ exposure to trade with China by  conducting a 
firm-level survey of 4  000 German firms in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade. Firms were 
asked if they rel ied on key inputs from China; whether the inputs came from their o wn production 
facilities in China or Chinese manufacturers; whether they plan to reduce their imports from China in 
the future, if so, how ( e.g. replace with European alternatives) and why.  The surveys allowed the 
authors to analyse responses by firm characteristics, like the size of the firm, which are not available 
using sectoral data such BACI or UN  Comtrade.

  Box 2.1. Related OECD work  
(Arriola et  al., 2020 [24]) used detailed trade and Trade in Value Added (TiVA) statistics to identify some 
of the potential supply chain bottlenecks in the context of trade cost shocks similar to those seen 
during the COVID -19 pan demic. The analysis  also used the OECD computable general equilibrium 
(CGE) trade model METRO to broadly compare economic efficiency and international transmission 
of trade cost shocks under different assumptions about countries’ openness, support to domes tic 
industries and flexibility of adjustments in international supply chains. In a follow up work,  Arriola, 
Kowalski and van Tongeren  (forthcoming [31]) are undertaking exploratory CGE modelling research 
on how shocks of a different nature may combine in the global economy and cause stress on 
specific products, trade routes or transport modes.  
More recently,  Arriola et al.  (2023 [19]) used similar techniques (i.e. detailed trade data, TiVA data and 
Inter-Country Input -Output (ICIO) techniques, as well as CGE modelling) to assess the exposure to 
trade with Russia and considered the econ omic costs of reduced trade scenarios for Russia and the 
countries imposing on it economic sanctions. The study proposed a simple method for classifying 
bilateral import links of OECD countries as ‘dependencies’ based on a combination of criteria involving  
non-OECD partner trade shares, overall concentration of imports and the extent of sourcing of similar 
products from other OECD countries. The method of classifying trade flows was also recently used in 
a study focusing on raw materials used intensely in g reen transition technologies in order to shed light 
on the extent of dependence of OECD countries on sourcing such raw materials from outside the OECD 
membership (Kowalski and Legendre, 2023 [33]). Schwellnus, Haramboure and Sam ek (2023 [2]) used an 
econometric model to estimate the relationship between domestic output changes and disruption of 
foreign supply, first in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic. The authors then applied the frame work 
to run counterfactual simulations to assess the impact of various strategies thought to cushion domestic 
production from foreign supply shocks: supplier diversification; partial onshoring; and  technological 
innovation . 
2.4. Key conclu sions and policy recommendations  from the literature  
Several insights  can be gleaned from the existing literature.  Firstly,  there is no one single method  that 
would allow a reliable identification of such trade dependencies: different approaches or even different 
thresholds  and parameters used within the same approach can yield somewhat different lists of 
products that meet diverse criticality criteria . However, despite their shortcomings, these  
methodologies and different thresholds and parameters can still be used to filter out the potentially 
problematic trade links which can be analysed further from more multidisciplinary angles.  
The structure of international trade is highly heterogenous: many trade links do not meet any of the 
criticality  criteria but also quite  a few meet one or more of them.  The lists of  dependencies also change 
over time. In several  studies that include  a time dimension, t he number of dependent products has 
varied over time, and there was also a churn of the specific products that have been identified as 
dependent over the last decade (Vicard and Wibaux, 2023 [14]). In addition, the s upply risk of  a 
commodity can change with market dynamic (Nassar et  al., 2020 [4]) and with natural, economic and 
geopolitical developments . These findings suggest that the identification of critical dependent produ cts 
should be done on a rolling window basis or some other methodology that takes multiple years into 
account (e.g . multi -year averages or totals).  
While supplier diversification can in principle  be a strategy to reduce supply risk failures, market 
concent ration may impede a firm’s ability to use this strategy to hedge risk. Vicard and Wibaux  
(2023 [14]) found  a shift in the origin of dependent products towards China, especially on highly 
concentrated products, which would bring into question the possibility of finding other suppliers. 
Bonneau and Nakaa (2020 [10]) found that some depende nt products are concentrated across EU 
Member states, which reduces the cushion from supply risk brought by relying on EU suppliers.  
Firm-level strategies to mitigate the risk of supply failures depend on firm characteristics.  Supplier 
diversification may be cost prohibitive for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) as they tend to 
          39  
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  use stockpiling as a risk mitigation strategy while larger firms prefer procurement diversification and 
supply chain monitoring (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]). In this respect, the authors suggest more SME -friendly 
designs of trade agreements , citing harmonization of standards and rules of origin as a good place to 
start as it would reduce the cost of diversifying suppliers. In fact, these harmonization o f rules and 
standards would help all types of firms  and not just SMEs (Arnold et  al., 2023 [23]). Additionally, the 
harmonization of technical standards would facilitate product substitution (Arriola et  al., 2020 [24])as 
would lowering tariff and non -tariff barriers (Arnold et  al., 2023 [23]) which would also mitigate the 
negative impact of a supply shock.  
There is an economic cost of reducing trade exposure by bring ing production closer to home.  
Modelling analyses have been used to economically assess decoupling, reshoring or near -shorin g as 
a way to protect domestic industries from supply shocks  (Bolhuis, Chen and Kett, 2023 [16]), (Flach 
et al., 2021 [6]) (CPB, 2022 [30]) (Arnold  et al., 2023 [23]) (Arriola et  al., 2020 [24]). The studies find that 
there are economic costs to reducing trade with important partners. While more localised regimes may 
cushion domestic industries from shocks originating in other  regions, these types of regimes also 
mean less diversification in supp liers, less scope for adjustments once a shock occurs, and increased 
the exposure to domestic shocks, while lowering economic efficiency. Moreover, moving some or all 
of production closer to home require s some large up -front investment costs and  could resu lt higher 
production costs. Countries may also lack the ecosystem of specialised suppliers and high -skilled 
workers  (Schwellnus, Haramboure and Samek, 2023 [2]). 
There is strength in numbers.  While a single country migh t not have the same economic leverage vis-
à-vis a large trading partner such as China, groups of countries taken together could be more 
economically relevant as a trading partner. This is important in the context of calls for decoupling from 
certain partne rs to protect domestic industries from supply failures that may result from changing 
geopolitical relations. For example, Baur and Flach (2022 [7]) argue the EU as a whole is the most 
important supplier of intermediate inputs and the second most important sales market for China from 
a value -added perspective, which should in principle enable the  EU to take a clear and self -determined 
stance towards China. Therefore, the goal of policy in Europe  should not be  ‘decoupling ’ from China, 
but primarily the avoidance of one -sided dependencies.  
Several studies  focused on Europe  recommend more cooperation and dialogue across the EU and 
member states  (Baur and Flach, 2022 [7]) and (Bonneau and Nakaa, 2020 [10])) to consult with Member 
states on supply chain vulnerabilities, develop a common definition of goods and services considered 
“critical”, and strengthen the EU common market. There  are also benefits to be g ained through 
cooperation at the multi -lateral level (Bonneau and Nakaa, 2020 [10]) in ensuring that unilateral 
initiatives to strength en and secure supply chains comply with global trading rules or finding a multi -
lateral appro ach to supply chain issues (The White House, 2021 [15]).  
Whatever policy interventions governments prescribe, the policy needs to match the problem and 
should be grounded in business reality (  (Baldwin and Freeman, 2022 [26]) citing Miro udot, 2020). There 
are some “no -regret” policies for governments, such as improving information and timely data to help 
monitor and identify supply chain vulnerabilities , risks, and bottlenecks in critical sectors (  (Baldwin 
and Freeman, 2022 [26]), (Bonneau and Nakaa, 2020 [10]), (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]), (Korniyenko, Pinat and 
Dew, 2017 [11]), (Arriola et  al., 2020 [24])). Moreover, government should include businesses and other 
economic actors in the discussions of vulnerabilities in  supply (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]). Governments also 
could organised supply chain stress test s and crisis scenario simulations to identify weak points in the 
supply chain  ( (Flach et  al., 2021 [6]),  (Arriola et  al., 2020 [24])). If under exceptional cases deemed 
important to national security or public health, governments decide to intervene, the policy should be 
based on a transparent catalogue of ideas and designe d in accordance to WTO law (Baur and Flach, 
2022 [7]), and the case for intervention needs to demonstrate that its benefit outweighs its cost 
(Productivity Commission, 2021 [8]).

  3.  Identifying  trade  dependencies using detailed merchandise trade data  
Analysis presented in this chapter builds on an approach to identifying trade dependencies  using 
detailed trade data  employed  earlier at the OECD (Arriola et  al., 2023 [19]), (Kowalski and Legendre, 
2023 [33]) and elsewhere  [ (McKinsey Global Institute, 2023 [34]), (European Commission, 2021 [13]), 
(Vicard and Wibaux, 2023 [14]), (Jiang, 2021 [9]), (Productivity Commission, 2021 [8]).Trade dependencies 
are identified using combine d criteria of high bilateral trade s hares and high overall concentration  of 
trade.   
Conducted  at HS 6 -digit level  of product classification, as well as some of the more aggregated product 
categories based on the HS classification (including some of those that have been identified in the 
recent literature as ‘strategic ’, i.e. Hung  (2023 [35]) and IMF (2023 [18])), this approach allows  painting a 
fairly granular picture of trade linkages  across diverse products  (5022 products) a nd a comprehensive 
coverage of trading countries ( 238 countries ). To study the evolution of dependencies in time, this 
work covers  a relatively  long historical period  for which internationally -comparable data at the detailed 
product level is available (1995-2021 ).  
While the analysis is global in its design, the presentation of results focuses on the main characteristics 
of trade linkages of the OECD membership as a group; individual G7 economies (Canada, France, 
Italy, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States) ; Australia and Korea, the 
Netherlands as well as three other larger individual EU countries (Spain, Poland, Swede n); EU27 as 
a block; and the MNOE countries (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia,  and South Africa)  
individu ally and as a group . 
3.1. Introduction  
Identification of specific products or trade links which might meet the trade dependency criteria  [1) high 
risk of disruption ; 2) high economic (or other) importance ; and 3) constrained possibility of substitution ] 
can be  performed on a case -by-case  basis , draw ing on expert knowledge of specific industries, firms, 
products or commercial links . However, countries typically trade thousands of products with tens or 
hundreds of partners and such an approach can be qu ite resource -intensive  unless there are strong 
a priori  indications which trade links should be spotlighted .  
Such prioritisation can therefore be facilitated by a large -scale quantitative analys is of trade indicators 
which aim to capture  some of the above criteria of trade dependency, such as , for example,  the 
economic significance and possibility of substitution. This can help sift thro ugh a large number of 
bilateral trade relationships at  a detailed  product level  and help identify the potential dependency 
candidates , which can be studied further by exports and can include  separate geopolitical (or other) 
assessment s of potential disruption risks.  
Such a  large -scale  identification of possible cases of trade dependencies based on objective  trade  
indicators , and a broad assessment of their economic significance, structure and evolution  in time , is 
the approach adopted  in the analysis  presented in this  chapter . The analysis builds on an approach 
to identifying trade dependencies used earlier at the OECD (e.g.  (Arriola et  al., 2023 [19]), (Kowalski 
and Legendre, 2023 [33])) and outside (e.g. (McKinsey Global Institute, 2023 [34]), (European 
Commission, 2021 [13]), (Ambroziak et  al., 2023 [36]), (Vicard and Wibaux, 2023 [14]), (Jiang, 2021 [9]), 
(Productivity Commission, 2021 [8])) which combine s an analysis of bilateral trade shares and trade 
concentration ratios. Conducted at the 6 -digit level of the UN’s Harmonised System (HS6 thereafter)  
using detailed gross import and export data from the 2023 version of  CEPII’s BACI dataset30 and more 
 
 
30 Note that, as pointed out by (Thissen, Ivanona and Mandras, 2019 [53]), in the CEPII’s BACI dataset, data for 
EU Members is not adjusted for re -exports or re -imports. The aut hors of this current  report are also not aware 
of any other trade dataset at the detailed product level , and with a global coverage , that consistently  incorporates 
such an adjustment  (e.g. UN Comtrade data suffers from the same problem) . This is why CEPII BACI was

  aggregated product categories derived from  the HS classification (including some of those that have 
been identified in the recent literature as ‘strategic ’ (Hung, 2023 [35]) and (IMF, 2023 [18])) this approach 
allows  painting  a fairly granular picture of trade linkages across diverse products (5 022 products)31 
and a comprehensive coverage of trading countries (238 countries).   
To study the evolution of dependencies in time, t he analysis  covers a  relatively  long historical period 
for which harmonised trade  data at the product level is available (1995 -2021). Since trade values can 
vary a lot from one year to another, especially for more disaggregated HS product categories, three -
year32 averages are calculated to track evolution of dependencies in time for the following six sub-
periods: 1997 -99; 2002 -04; 2007 -09; 2 012-14; 2017 -19; and 2020 -21. 
While the analysis is global in its design, the presentation of results focuses on trade linkages of the 
OECD countries  as a group; individual G7 economies (Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, the 
United Kingdom , and the Un ited States); Australia and Korea, the Netherlands as well as three other 
larger individual EU countries (Spain, Poland, Sweden) , EU27 as a block,  and the MNOE  countries 
(Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) individually and as a grou p.  
3.2. Global concentration s of imports and exports  
The methodology which uses  the concept of trade concentration as an approach to identifying  trade 
dependency  in this chapter is discussed  in Annex 8.1.1.  
Exports  of HS6 products are on average two times more concentrated across exporting  countries than 
imports are across importing countries (Figure 3.1). For exports, the average value of HHI has been 
approaching the value of 0.2 prior to the COVID -19 pandemic  (the period  2017 -19), which, as 
discussed above, can be considered as indicating a moderately high level of concentration.   
One possible explanation  of the higher global concentration of exports is provided by the  theory of 
international trade  based on the concept of  comparative advantage : countries differ more with respect 
to what they supply to world markets ( i.e. they specialise in production  of some products due to 
different natural endowments or technologies ) than with respect to what they source from world 
marke ts (i.e. consumers in different countries have relatively similar preferences and consume similar 
bundles of products ). Note also that this is consistent with the pre -occupation with import 
dependencies as seen from the national perspectives in the recent public debates. This is further 
explored in Section 3.4.  
Both export and import  concentration ratios  have been increasing gradually since the late 1990s until 
the COVID -19 pandemi c. This  possibly reflects the growing levels of specialisation in global valu e 
chains ( GVCs ) which proliferated during this period.  In GVCs, specialisation  occurs  at a finer  —
intermediate input  — level and this has resulted in a growing number of traded intermediate products 
 
 
chosen as an appropriate dataset for this analysis. Still, for many countries, including the Netherlands due to 
the role of the port of Rotterdam as a gateway to EU trade, re -exports may play an important role depending on 
product traded . Therefore, s ome of the import dependencies calculated for countries for which re -exports are 
an important phenomenon in this report may be exaggerated in the sense that these products do not end up 
being used by domestic producers or consu mers but are re -exported. On the other hand, some of the services 
industries which are handling the re -exporting activity ( e.g. shipping and transport services ), and which may still 
have an important share in the country’s GDP and income , would still  be ‘dependent’ on such re -exports. Note 
also that Chapter  4 and Chapter  5 of this report on the results of analysis , which is based , respectively,  on the 
OECD Inter -Country Input Ou tput tables and GTAP database , which are both adjusted for re -exports, do not 
suffer from this problem. However, they incorporate trade data at a much higher level of product aggregation.  
31 Note that w hile the level of aggregation at which the analysis is conducted  is as granular as available data 
allows, it is still a potential const raint as most products are highly differentiated by a myriad of characteristics 
which determine uniqueness and substitutability. This heterogeneity may not be well captured even by the 
relatively disaggregated HS6 trade data used in the paper.  Policies aim ing to minimi se trade risks may be not  
based on the aggregated categories that are included in the analysis , but rather more detailed supply chain 
analyses . For more discussion of this issue , see Annex 8.1.1.  
32 A two -year period is considered for the most recent years 2020 -21.

  and inputs  which in turn is consistent with growing levels of trade  concentration. While likely indicating 
the growing specialisation of production and trade in GVCs , at the same time  — and in line with the 
logic of concentration as a factor contributing to  trade dependency  — the increase  in global trade 
concentrations  ratios may also be indicative of the perception of a global increase in vulnerabili ties to 
unexpected trade shocks .  
However, there is also considerable variation around the mean values of the concentr ation indices 
across all HS6 products. For example, in  the period  2017 -19, fifty -two out of 4  839 HS6 products with 
active trade links, which were equivalent to approximately 1% of all active links, were exported by only 
one country (i.e. they had HHI=1). More than ninety exported products had HHI readings equal or 
higher than 0.75 (2% of all active links). In contrast, 3  502 products  — or 72% of exported products  — 
had global export HHIs lower than or equal to 0.2. This suggests that exports of an overwhel ming 
majority of traded products were  relatively well diversified but exports of close to 30% of traded 
products were  relatively highly concentrated.

3.2.1. Global concentrations of exports and imports across HS2 sectors  
There are also considerable deviations from the time trend of increasing export concentrations across 
products and across periods: for some products and in some periods global concentration s of exports 
and imports  actually fell.  
A considerable  volatility  of global concentration ratios in time observed for some products makes it  
difficult to clearly establish  for which  sectors  export concentration changed the most .33 However,  if we

  take the  simple measure of  average relative change in the value of HHI of each sector (HS2) from the 
beginning until the end of the pre -COVID period, we see that the list of 30  HS2 sectors  with the l argest 
increases is rather diverse (Figure 3.2, left hand panel). It contains some raw, or semi -processed , 
industrial materials such as tin, lead, copper, or ceramic and glass products, but it also contains 
several materials and finished and semi -finished of the textiles and apparel industry as well as some 
manufactured products.  
The list of sectors  where the increases in export concentration ha ve been the smallest (or negative, 
meaning that global export concentration has actually fallen, Figure 3.2, right-hand panel) is also 
revealing  as it contain s several technologically advanced manufacturing sectors, such as machinery 
and equipment, optical and precision equipment, iron and steel, motor vehicles, aircraft, 
pharmaceutical products, mineral fuels, nicke l, fertilisers but also animal products, cereals and dairy  
products.  
Several sectors which experienced the largest (smallest) increases in export concentration ratios were 
also the sectors with the most (least) concentrated exports at the end of the pre -COVID19 period 
(Figure 3. 3).34

  this list, as do products of a f ew manufacturing industries such as inorganic chemicals (HS28), and 
some metals such as tin and lead (HS80 and HS78 respectively).  
Amongst others , this may suggest that the concentration reflects natural and economic factors, such 
as natural endowments , comparative advantage  and low costs of production and processing in some 
locations (including economies of scale).  On average there  seems to be  a fair amount of competition 
in world markets and that specific exporters and importers have a limited control over price formation. 
In addition, these moderate global concentrations also mean that in principle international markets 
offer good options for  diversification of both export and imports at the national level It seems therefore 
that economic factors , rather than strategic or geopolitical factors, are some of the main drivers of 
these global export concentrations.

3.2.2. Global export and import concentrations in ‘strategic ’ sectors  
Indeed, using the IMF list  of strategic products and its mapping to the International Standard Industrial 
Classification of all economic activities (ISIC , Revision 4 ) [ (IMF, 2023 [1]), and Annex 8. 1] we see these 
strategic products  are on average both less export - and import - concentrated than all traded HS6 
products (Figure 3. 4). This suggest that  the global trade of products of some of the industries that are 
qualified as strategic based on expert or political judgment is actually  relatively well diversified. This 
means that these strategic products can be sourced fr om — or exported to  — a large r number  of 
countries  than, on average,  all traded products . This finding is similar to the one in Kowalski and 
Legendre (2023) who found t hat on average trade of materials critical for green transition is lower than 
that of all merchandise products.

  Among the strategic products,  there are some that are more , and there are some that are less , 
concentrated.  Manufacture of electronics35, with t he global import HHI approaching 0.3 in 2017 -19, 
comes through as the most export -concentrated strategic sector, followed by mining of uranium and 
thorium ores, manufacture of other porcelain and ceramic products and manufacture of domestic 
appliances. In the 2017 -19 period, for all four of these top export -concentrated sectors , the  HHIs 
exceeded 0.2. We also see that , in these and  other most export -concentrated sectors , concentration 
has increased significantly  since the 1990s , and that this increase was indeed the most significant for 
the manufacture of electronics (Figure 3. 6).

3.3. Country -level concentrations of imports and exports  
The corresponding country -level concentrations of imports and exports are higher  than the global 
concentrations . That is, countries typically source their imports from  ― and send their exports to  ― 
fewer partners than it is in princip le globally possible. On average, both country -level imports and 
exports are relatively  moderately concentrated with HHI values exceeding 0.3 for imports and 0.2 for 
exports  (Figure 3. 7).36 Country -level concentrations are also higher than the global ones for products 
on our ‘strategic product’ list. In addition, at the country level, imports have become visibly more 
concentrated throughout the investigated period while export concentration has also grown , albeit less 
quickly.  
The higher country -level concentrations likely reflect a combination of natural factors , such as the role 
of geography and trade costs  particularly in the context of GVC integration which is highly regional  as 
well as preferences and policies (e.g.  existence of regional and preferential trade agreements  which 
by design tend to lower trade costs and give other advantage s to selected  trade partners ). Strategic 
economic policies of importers and exporters could also have played a role. On the export si de, China 
may be a case in point as the overall rise in national import concentrations has coincided with raising 
shares of China as a source of imports (Figure 3.7, Panel B).  
 
 
36 Note also that country -level Import concentrations are higher than country -level export concentrations. This 
finding is consistent with the finding that at the global level exports are more concentrat ed than imports (recall 
Figure 3.1 and the associated interpretation: country -level imports are expected to be more concentrated than 
country -level exports  because countries differ more in terms of what they produce than in terms of what they 
consume ).

Building on the observation of differences between the global and national trade concentrations, a  
recent study by  McKinsey Global Institute  (2023 [34]) suggests there is interest in distinguishing cases  
of trade d products  where countries rely on significantly fewer suppliers or customers than is offered 
by the global economy as ones where “concentration is coming from economy -specific choices”.

  Building on  this suggestion,  the data on global and country -level concentration has been used to 
evaluate the incidence of such ‘excessive’ concentration cases for imports. To do so , an arbitrary 
criteria regarding the relative values of the respective global and country -level HHIs  had to be applied . 
Excessive concentration of imports has been defined where the value of country -level HHI for example 
is more than double the value of the corresponding HHI for global exports  (so the national 
concentration of impor ts of a given product across all supplying countries is at least two times higher 
than the concentration of global exports of the same product) . To further constrain the spectrum of 
cases of excessive concentration, an additional minimum cut -off value of HHI calculated for global 
product -level exports was set at 0.2. This means that only products with a global exports HHI of at 
least 0.2 and products with country -level imports HHI of at least 0.4 were  considered  as excessively 
concentrated .  
Figure 3. 8 shows the average per country incidence of  HS6 products with  such excessive import 
concentration for all countries in the sample, OECD countries , MNOES  and all other  countries  
(i.e. countries which are not members of either the OECD or MNOE  grouping ). Interestingly, the global 
incidence of excessive concentration has been on the rise in the investigated period, and this has 
been accounted for mainly by the MNOE  and other countries, while excessive import concentration 
has decreased on average for the OECD grouping.  We also see that this decline for the OECD was 
interrupted by two periods of small increases  around the Global Financial Crisis and around the 
COVID -19 pandemic.  
Figure  3.8. Average incidence of ‘e xcessive’ import concentration by country grouping  
Average number of imported HS6 products with ‘excessive’ import concentration per country  
in each of the country groupings  
 
Note: “ Excessive import concentration is defined in cases of bilateral import links at the product level where the value of country -level HHI 
for imports is more than double the value of the corresponding HHI for global exports. To further constrain the spectrum of c ases of 
excessive concentration, an additional minimum cut -off value of HHI calculated for global product -level exports was set at 0.2. This means 
that only products with a global exports HHI of at least 0.2 and products with country -level imports HHI of at least 0.4 were considered.  
Source: OECD calculations using  the BACI data.  
For the MNOE grouping, excessive import concentration has increased in each or the periods and 
more markedly than for other non -OECD countries. In the period 2020 -21, a MNOE country had on 
average twice as many products with excessive impor t concentrations than in 1997 -99 and 40% more 
than an average OECD country (Figure 3. 9). There is also interesting heterogeneity across the MNOE 
countries. Throughout the investigated period, China had the smallest average number of excessive 
concentration s and for China this number increased the least among the MNOEs. Somewhat similarly 
to China, Russia started with the second lowest number of excessive import concentrations, and it

  had the second lowest growth rate of such concentrations. Brazil on the ot her hand had the largest 
number of concentrations among the MNOES while Indonesia recorded the highest growth rate of 
excessive import concentrations.  
Figure  3.9. Incidence of ‘excessive’ import concentration  in MNOEs

Note: “ Excessive import concentration is defined in cases of bilateral import links at the product level where the value of country -level HHI

excessive concentration, an additional minimum cut -off value of HHI calculated for global product -level exports was set at 0.2. This means 
that only products with a global exports HHI of at least 0.2 and products with country -level imports HHI of at leas t 0.4 were considered.  
Source: OECD calculations using the BACI data . 
There is also a considerable variation in the incidence of excessive import concentration among the 
OECD countries . EU Members , particularly Germany, France , and Italy, which have the lowest 
incidence of excessive import concentrations in this grouping, ha ve on average around three times 
fewer excessive import concentrations than OECD countries  with the highest number of 
concentrations (Mexico, Chile, Korea)  (Figure 3.1 0). We also see that Germany, France a nd Italy  have 
reduced their excessive import concen tration in the investigated period while Mexico , Chile , and Korea  
have increased it (although Mexico also decreased its excessive import concentrations in the first half 
of the period)  (Figure 3.1 1). Note that similarly to the other moderately sized EU eco nomies, the 
Netherlands’ position is much below the OECD average but above the countries with the fewest 
excessive concentrations.  
We also see that the countries with the highest incidence of such concentrations globally do not belong 
to either the OECD or  the MNOE  grouping, and they tend to have up to three times as many excessive 
concentrations than an average OECD or MNOE  country. Many of these countries have much lower 
per capita incomes as compared with the OECD and MNOES  and several of them are landlocked  and 
have recently suffered,  or are currently suffering, from  a military conflict (Figure 3.1 2).

3.4. Bilateral trade dependencies  
The bilateral dimension of trade dependencies is perhaps of the most interest . This is because  different 
trading partners may specialise in production  (and consumption ) of different products and some risks 
of trade disruptions may be determined at a partne r country or bilateral level.  In addition , the bilateral 
dimension of trade dependency underpins  the adopted empirical approach as the HHI used earlier to 
measure  the country -level import and export concentration is in fact a summary measure of all the 
bilateral shares  that account for a country’s imports (or exports ) of a given product .  
Defined  according to the methodology described  in Annex 8.1.1 , dependencies account for 4.9% of 
all active bilateral import links across the OECD and for 4.6% across the MNOES  and, i n value terms,  
they account for respectively 42 and 45% of the total value s of imports  of these country groups 
(Table 3.1). This again suggest that the bulk of imports of OECD countries and MNOE s can be 
attributed to relatively few highly concentrated import links . This suggests that beyond being of interest  
to specific countries , sectors  and products, dependencies  also matter across the economy as a whole .  
Import dependencies are also more import ant than export dependencies across the OECD and MNOE 
groupings both in terms of counts and import shares. In the most recent period, the share of 
dependencies in all active bilateral  export flows (i.e. the share of count of these export links in all activ e 
export links) was at, 2.4% and 1.7% for, respectively, the OECD and the MNOE country groupings 
(Table 3.2). The corresponding shares in the total value of exports were 25% and 14%.

  3.4.1. Evolution of bilateral import dependencies37 
The first insight from the numbers is that i mport depe ndencies declined between 1997 -99 and 2017 -
19, both across the OECD and the MNOE s. The decline  was more rapid for OECD countries . Both 
groupings also e xperienced an increase in import  dependencies in the COVID -19 pandemic period 
(2020 -21) (Figure 3. 13). Second, zooming in on strategic products, the decline  of average incidence 
of dependency  is confirmed  for both country groupings  (Figure 3. 14).

Canada  has overtaken  Japan in the mid -2010s and was the G7 country with the highest number 
dependencies  for both all and strategic product lists  in the most recent  periods  (Figure  3.15). Both 
these countries had markedly h igher levels of import dependencies than the other G7 countries where  
all and strategic dependencies generally decreased in the main period, although the United States 
saw a temporary increase in dependencies in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis  (GFC)  of 
2008 -09. In all G7 countries but the United States, import dependencies increased in the COVID -19 
period.  Interestingly, in Germany, the number of all import dependencies has been falling constantly 
in the pre COVID -19 period while the number of strategic dependencies first fell and then started 
increasing after the GFC (Figure 3.1 5, Panel B).

Among the other OECD countries, Korea has had a markedly higher level of all and strategic 
dependencie s than other countries in this grouping, even if it reduced them somewhat throughout 
most of the period (Figure 3.16). The other countries in this grouping had somewhat similar levels of 
all and strategic dependencies and, except Australia, all of these co untries reduced dependencies in 
the main period before seeing an increase in the COVID -19 period.  
The Netherlands ha d been gradually reducing all and strategic dependencies in the pre -COVID period.

  The MNOE  grouping presents a less uniform picture.  Indone sia’s count of dependencies has remained 
stable and the country maintained the highest level of dependencies among MNOEs. South Africa and 
India have gradually increased their dependencies, while China, Brazil and Russia reduced them. All 
MNOEs but Brazil (and including China) saw their import dependencies increase in the COVID -19 
period (Figure 3.17, Panel A).  
The MNOE grouping presents a more diverse picture as the levels of dependency across all products 
were more stable than across ‘strategic’ products,  for which dependencies increased gradually on 
average in this country grouping (Figure 3.17, Panel B). In India and Indonesia, the growth of strategic 
dependencies has been the most pronounced. Russia saw a decrease in strategic dependencies in 
the period  2007 -19 which was nevertheless reversed in the period 2020 -21. China gradually 
decreased its strategic import dependencies in the pre -COVID19 period.

3.4.2. Regional dimensions  of dependencies  
Import dependencies  tend to be concentrated regionally , both across all products and across  strategic  
sectors .38 Among OECD countries, for example, Canada, Mexico and the United States tend to have 
a relatively high proportion of dependencies with each other and with other countries in the Americas . 
Similarly, the bulk of import dependencies in EU is with other EU countries  (Figure 3.1 8). Such regional 
concentration of dependencies is consistent with the regional nature of integration in GVCs , which is 
 
 
38 This sub -section discusses developments for all products , but the findings for strategic products are qualitatively 
similar. The next sub -section zooms in on dependencies in strategic products.

For EU Members in particular, an overwhelming majority of their dependencies is with other EU 
Members (77% on average, Figure 3.20). For some of the most dependent import -dependent EU 
countries such as Slovakia or Luxembourg these ratios are even higher (82 and 87%, respectively) 
(Annex Figure 8.6). The United Kingdom and the Netherlands, on the other hand, are the two 
European countries with the l owest  — even if still quite high  — shares of dependencies with EU 
Members : 56 and 58% respectively (Annex Figure 8.6). For comparison, in OECD countries located 
in the Americas, only 44% of dependencies on average originate within the Americas, while for t he 
Asian OECD countries approximately 51% of dependencies on average originate within Asia.  
For EU Members , these findings  reflect the high levels of trade integration in the European single 
market. Some types  of idiosyncratic shocks  are less likely withi n the European single market and its 
institutions are helping with adjustment to various asymmetric shocks through provisions aiming to 
establish free movement of goods, services, people and capital between participating countries.39 
Taking into account th e depth of international economic and political integration within the EU, which 
is higher than in any other OECD region, the EU comes across  as the least externally  exposed  region 
of the OECD.

  However, there are also noteworthy trans -regional patterns and developments. First, OECD countries 
in the Americas are a lot more dependent  on European countries (20% of these countries’ 
dependencies originate in Europe, Figure 3.20) than European countrie s are on countries located  in 
the Americas (5%).  
Interestingly, Asia is the most prominent trans -regional source  of import dependencies  (Figure 3. 19) 
and this dependency has increased significantly  across all OECD regions  since the late 1990s. For 
example , while in the period 1997 -99 Asia accounted for on average 17 and 10% of dependencies in, 
respectively, the Americas and Europe, in the 2017 -19 these shares were at 34 and 16% (Figure 3. 19). 
The expansion of import dependencies  on Asia was the most prominent for the two OECD countries 
located in Oceania  (Australia and New Zealand):  it increased from 30%  of all import dependencies  in 
1997 -99 to 49% in 2017 -2019. This region is in fact the only one in which the share of dependencies 
originating in Asia exceeds the share of intra -regional ones (12% of all dependencies in 2017 -19).  
The distinction between China and other Asian countries in Figure 3.20 reveals that the bulk of the 
increase in dependen cy on Asia was  accounted for by Chin a. The share s of import dependencies of 
OECD Europe and OECD Americas accounted for by China increased  from, respectively,  5 and 2% 
in 1997 -99 to 21 and 8% in 2017 -19 (Figure 3. 19).

regions  – evolution in time  
Share of import dependencies across all products by region of exporter 1997 -99 and 2017 -19 
 
Source: OECD calculations using the BACI data.  
Overall, in the period 2017 -19 China accounted for 13% of all OECD import dependencies, more than 
three times as much as in 1997 -99 (4%), while dependency shares of the most prominent OECD 
partners such as Germany or the United States declined (Figure  3.20, Panel A). China also dwarf ed 
other partners in terms of the increase in the number of import dependencies of OECD countries 
(Figure 3.20, Panel B).  
Moreover, despite the globally decreasing total number of OECD import dependencies, the number 
(and thus the share) of OECD dependenc ies on China has actually increased (recall Figure 3.13 and 
see Figure 3.21). A yet more pronounced expansion of dependency on China can be observed in the 
MNOE grouping where the share of dependencies on China increased from approximately 6% in 
1997 -99 to  24% in 2017 -19 (Figure 3.22).

  3.5.4 Evolution of bilateral dependencies in strategic product s 
When all trading partners are considered, i mport dependencies of OECD countries in both all and in 
strategic sectors fell. However, they almost tripled  for imports from China  of all products  (190% 
increase between 1997 -99 and 2017 -19, Figure 3.2 3) and they more than triple d for strategic products 
(240% increase between 1997 -99 and 2017 -19).  
China is also the exporter  for which the number of OECD dependencies in strategic products increased 
by far the most  across all the exporters  (Figure 3.2 4). While  the numbers are much s maller than for 
China, t he list of exporting countries accounting for the largest increases in  OECD ’s dependencies in 
strategic sectors features also other Asian  exporters such as India, Thailand, Viet  Nam and Malaysia, 
as well as  some dynamically growing OECD exporters such as Korea or Poland  (Figure 3.2 4).

  When all trading  partners are considered, the product structure of OECD’ strategic dependencies has 
been rather stable and , in terms of the absolute numbers,  it has been dominated by the manufacture 
of cement lime and plaster . The shares of other strategic products with largest numbers of OECD’s 
import dependencies (such as manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen compounds , manufacture of 
plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms , manufacture of watches and clocks  and m ining of other 
non-ferrous metal ores ). 
However, when these shares are scaled by the number of HS6 products that belong to each of these 
larger strategic p roduct categories, the rankings of products with the highest incidence of 
dependencies change quite significantly. Such ‘scaled’ rankings of products with most dependencies 
are presented in Figure 3.2 5 for the OECD as whole, for the EU as a whole and for t he Netherlands.  
Figure 3.26 shows the expansion (or the lack of such expansion) of dependency on all trading partners 
and on China for the top six ‘strategic’ products with the highest incidence of dependencies for the 
OECD as a whole and Figure 3.27 shows  the equivalent information for the EU as a whole. For the 
OECD as a whole, the shares of China have grown visibly for the manufacture of chemicals, domestic 
appliances and cutting, shaping and finishing of stone, but not for the other three products. For the 
EU, China’s expansion among the top dependent products is even less prominent.  
Overall, the extent of import dependency on China across OECD countries varies considerably across 
the different OECD sectors and countries. For the OECD and EU groupings, a s well as for the 
Netherlands individually, China normally does not manifestly account for unusually high shares of 
dependencies in ‘strategic’ product categories where these regions record the highest overall levels 
of dependency (e.g. manufacture of ceme nt, lime and plaster , manufacture of fertilizers and nitrogen 
compounds , manufacture of plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms , manufacture of watches 
and clocks  and m ining of other non -ferrous metal ores ).  
Nevertheless, for the OECD as whole, as well as in most cases for the EU, China’s share of 
dependencies exceeds 10% in several ‘strategic’ industries such as manufacture of refractory 
products , cutting, shaping and finishing of stone , manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical 
and botanical products , manufacture of lifting and handling equipment , manufacture of  consumer 
electronics , and manufacture of electronic components and boards ) (Figure 3.2 5).

  When individual EU countries are considered  separately , they display fairly similar structures of 
strategic import  dependency when  all partners  are considered and a s omewhat less similar structure  
when only China is considered (Figure 3. 28). This suggest s that EU Members may have more similar 
sectoral interests when it comes to reducing the overall import dependencies than they have when it 
comes to reducing import dep endencies on China. For Finland, for example, the strategic sector 
structure of import dependencies on all partners has a 97% overlap with the corresponding structure 
for the EU as a whole, while for Germany this overlap is at approximately 87%. However, w hen it 
comes to dependency on China, while Spain sectoral structure overlap by some 94%, those for 
Luxembourg  or Lithuania  overlap by ‘only’ , respectively, 71 and  77%. For the Netherlands, the 
overlaps with the EU as a whole are relatively high for both de pendencies on all partners (96%) and 
on China (90%). This suggests that it has a relatively high interest in co -ordinating policy responses 
at the EU level.  
Figure  3.28. Individual EU countries: Similarity of sector structure of import dependencies  
in strategic sectors with that of the EU as a whole  
Finger -Kreinin index of similarity of the structure of import dependency with that for the EU as a whole  (2017 -19) 
 
Note: Th is figure shows the Finger -Kreinin of trade similarity applied to the sectoral structure of import dependencies for each individual 
country and compared wi th the corresponding sectoral structure of import dependencies for the EU as whole. The values of the  index vary 
between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that a given EU  country’s dependencies are identical in their sectoral structure to those for the E  
as a whole.  A value of 0. 7 can in turn  be approximately interpreted as representing a 70% overlap in depend ency structures between the 
given country and EU as a whole.

Bilateral import dependencies of the  Netherlands  
The list of the Netherlands’ top strategic sectors with highest incidence of import dependencies is  
indeed similar to that for the EU as a whole ( Panels B and C of Figure 3.2 5) although there are also 
some differences . For example, f or the EU a s whole and the Netherlands, the manufacture of other 
porcelain  and ceramic products , while not one of the most dependent of the ‘strategic’  sectors , records 
the highest shares of dependency on China (3 4% of dependencies in the EU and  39% in the 
Netherlands) . However, some of the imports  which are quite dependent on China in the Netherlands 
are not that depende nt on China for  the EU as a  whole . 
Figure 3. 29 presents a detailed summary  of the Netherland’s import dependencies in strategic sectors 
given the overall counts of dependencies at the product level (in this case not scaled by the number 
of corresponding product lines) and the shares in these counts of China. Sectors with highest 
dependency on China were those with fewer overall number of dependencies, such as other porcelain 
and ceramic products  (44% of dependency on China in 2017 -19), cutting, shaping and finishing of 
stone  (36%) or manufacture of refractory  products ( 32%). In several other sectors the dependency on 
China has also reached relatively high levels in different periods, but there are also a range of products 
where the Netherlands has import dep endencies, but they tended to be not with China.

  Focusing on non -EU sources of dependencies in the six strategic sectors with the largest  numbers of 
import dependencies , we find that for the manufacture of basic chemicals  and manufacture of coke 
oven products , more dependencies were  accounted for by the non -OECD partners, most notably and 
to some extent India (Figure 3.3 0).

Bilateral import dependencies of China  
The preceding  figures illustrate that China is an important and growing counter part in OECD import 
dependencies. But equivalent calculations for China suggest that OECD countries are an even more 
important counterpart  in import depen dencies for China.  This subsection provides an overview of 
China’s own import dependencies while pay ing special attention to the position of the EU and the 
Netherlands as exporters.   
In the most recent periods , OECD countries as a whole accounted for approximately 70% of China’s 
import dependencies in ‘strategic’ products.  Japan and the United States are t he countries which have 
accounted for the highest shares of China’s dependencies in all products as well as in ‘strategic’ 
products throughout the period Japan and the United States are the two individual OECD countries 
which continue to account for the hi ghest shares of these dependencies (respectively 12 and 10%, 
Figure 3.3 1).  
Nevertheless, the EU as group has become progressively more important and most recently 
accounted for 2 9% up from 19% in the late 1990s .

OECD, n on-MNOE countries (21%). Also, in contrast to Japan and the United States, the share of the 
EU in China’s ‘strategic’ dependencies grew over the investigated period. This suggest that the EU is 
overall the most  — and increasingly  — important counterpart for China’s in terms of its import 
dependencies.  
Together with Germany, Italy, France and Sweden, the Netherlands is currently in the top -5 EU 
countries with highest shares of China’s import dependencies  in strategic products, accounting itself  
for 2% of them in 2020 -21. Interestingly, and in contrast to Japan and the United States, these 
countries have gradually increased their shares in China’s dependencies in the investigated period.  
These high levels of import dependency of China on OECD can  be seen across most ‘strategic’ 
industries. The EU on its own accounts for more than 40% of China’s import dependencies in 
industries such as manufacture of motor vehicles , manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal 
chemical and botanical products , manufac ture of bearings, gears, gearing and driving elements , 
manufacture of lifting and handling equipment , manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners  
(Figure 3.3 2).  
This list clearly includes several industries in which many OECD countries are also sig nificantly 
dependent on China, which underscores the mutual character of these dependencies.

3.5. Conclusions from detailed trade data analysis  
The results of this analysis confirm that there is a merit in the ongoing public debate on trade 
dependencies. Global production of products has become increasingly concentrated, and it tends to 
be increasingly clustered around some countries and regions. This not only due to natural and organic 
economic factors, such as natural endowments, comparative advantage, economies of scale , or GVC 
fragmentation, but also most likely policies.  
Having said that, the evidence presented shows also that large, if not d ominant, portions of global and 
national trade are relatively well diversified overall, and that international product markets are

  characterised by a fair amount of competition and limited control over supply or price formation of 
specific importers or exp orters.  
Some of the most striking findings include the fact that countries  — including OECD countries — 
typically source their imports from  — and ship their exports to  — fewer partners than is in principle 
globally possible . This reflects a combination of  natural factors, such as the role of geography and 
trade costs , but also national  preferences and policies. There is thus untapped potential in using 
international markets in order to diversify.  
In fact, our findings suggest that a significant number of  OECD countries have been able to take 
advantage of diversification possibilities offered by international markets, as testified, for example , by 
declining average rates of import concentrations and bilateral import dependencies  across the OECD 
membership . Similar reductions have not occurred in the major non -OECD economies most of which 
saw their dependencies increase.  
Which trading partners are the main counterparts in the highly concentrated trade linkages has been 
raised as one of the key issues in the trade dependency  debate. Here, too, some of our findings 
support a cautious approach to concentrated trade relations, while others are more reassuring .  
Dependency on China  has increased significantly across all OECD regions since the late 1990s. The 
count ry is now the single most important counterpart in trade dependencies of OECD as a whole (1 4% 
of OECD dependencies in ‘strategic’ products) and of several OECD countries individually. Trade 
dependencies of OECD economies on China also need to be put in the context of China’s 
dependencies on OECD. Here our results suggest that the OECD as group  ― and several OECD 
countries  on their own  ― are a much more important counterparts in dependencies of China 
(e.g. OECD as a group account  for 70% of China’s import dependencies in ‘strategic’ products). 
Moreover, China’s sectoral dependencies involving OECD countries include several industries in 
which several OECD countries also depend on China, which underscores the mutual character of 
trade dependencies.  
4. Measuring trade dependencies using the OECD TiVA data and ICIO techniques  
This section  analyses trade dependencies in the global economy using the OECD TiVA data and 
input -output methods. In contrast to the examination of gross trade flows presented in Chapter  3, this 
analysis considers not only direct, but also indirect trade links. On the other hand, it is carried out at a 
coarser level of industry aggregation.  
To gauge the importance of a country or industry within the broader economic system, the input -output 
literature employs a technique known as 'hypothetical extraction'. In this metho d, all trade flows 
involving a specific set of countries (or country -sector pairs) are either set to zero or reduced by a 
specific proportion. The ensuing changes in value added provide a measure of exposure to the 
hypothetical shock.  
In the core scenario,  the interdependencies between OECD and MNOE economies are assessed by 
reducing all trade flows between the two groups of countries by 10%. The data used are derived from 
the OECD ICIO table s with increased granularity, comprising 75 sectors and 75 countri es plus a rest 
of the world region. The list of countries covered by the analysis is in line with that of Chapter  3. 
4.1. Introduction  
To complement  descriptive statistical analysis of direct trade dependencies using detailed gross trade 
data and to shed more  light on their wider economic implications, Chapter s 4 and 5 explore trade 
dependencies through scenario analysis using respectively, the OECD ICIO  tables and  the 
‘hypothetical extraction’ methodology , and the OECD global CGE global trade model METRO. 
Scenarios considered in both analyses are largely the same and their specification reflects the terms 
of reference of the project as well as the requirements and constraints of the two methodologies.  
This chapter analyses  trade dependencies using TiVA data  and input -output methods.  Compared  to 
an analysis of gross trade flows like that of Chapter  3, the input -output approach takes a broader 
          77  
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  supply chain perspective. The aim is to capture not only those trade dependencies that are due to 
direct import -export  relationships, but also those that may result from indirect trade links.  An indirect 
trade link arises, for example, when a product exported from one country to another embeds a 
component produced in a third country.  This methodology also does away with t he issue of re -exports 
which is an improvement over the analysis in Chapter  3. 
In the input -output literature, a sector’s (or country’s) importance for the global economic system is 
generally assessed in terms of ‘backward ’ and ‘forward linkages ’. Backward  linkages  refer to the fact 
that, in any given country and industry, production processes make use of intermediate inputs sourced 
from other countries and industries. Respectively , forward linkages capture  the importance of 
countries and industries as outl ets for each other’s outputs. As noted, backward and forward linkages 
are either  direct  (e.g. foreign value added embodied in imported intermediate is used for production, 
and then final consumption, in the first importing country) or indirectly  (e.g. fore ign value added used 
in production is imported and exported multiple times) . 
A popular method for the analysis for input -output linkages  and one that is used for analysis in this 
chapter  is a technique called ‘hypothetical extraction’  (Miller and Blair, 2022 [38]). The hypothetical 
extraction method evaluates the economic significance of certain economic connections by calculating 
what would happen if those connections were removed or reduced while preserving the rest of the 
global trade and economic activity structure. In this setup, a negative trade shock adversely affects 
the economy of a country by restricting its access to imported inputs and to its export markets. At a 
basic level, the hypothetical extraction method yields a  measure of the loss of value added 
experienced as a result of the shock by each country and industry of the global economic system. A 
summary indicator of dependency at the country level can then be obtained by aggregating the 
industry -level results into a hypothetical change in GDP .  
The principal hypothetical extraction scenario analysed here reduces all trade flows between each of 
the OECD  countries  and each of the MNOEs  by 10 %. All the bilateral exports and imports of goods 
and services (both for trade in intermediate and final products) between the individual OECD countries 
and individual MNOEs  are reduced by 10%. All the other trade flows remain directly unaffected (but 
can be affected indirectly , for example,  through  interruption of indirect links involving OECD -MNOE 
trade  if such links exist ). Below, this principal scenario will be referred to as the ‘OECD -MNOE  trade 
shock’, or simply as the ‘trade shock’ when there is no risk of confusion. One of the advantages of t he 
hypothetical extraction methodology used here is that t he results of the principal scenario can be  
further decomposed to tease out the contribution s to the overall effect s of specific sectors and 
economie s where trade is being reduced . In this way, othe r potential sub-scenarios, which are subsets 
of principal scenarios (e.g. a reduction of trade between OECD countries and just China or Russia)  
can also be readily analysed .40The components  ― or ‘sub -scenarios’  ― we highlight here correspond 
to those analy sed using the OECD CGE METRO model in Chapter  5.  
The data used in this analysis come from an unpublished version of the OECD TiVA database with 
increased industry resolution (75 industries, as opposed to 46 in the official release). These data with 
increa se granularity are thoroughly consistent with (i.e. they aggregate up to) the published ones. The 
geographical coverage consists of 75 countries and a rest of the World region. All calculations are 
carried out on the basis of data for 2019, the most recent non -pandemic year for which data are 
available. It is therefore important to keep in mind tha t many important developments that took place 
afterwards – most notably, in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – are not captured by our 
analysis.  
As always, the results should be interpreted keeping in mind the characteristics of the methodolog y. 
Notably, the hypothetical extraction approach contains an implicit assumption that the intermediate 
inputs that were initially used but are not longer available need not be replaced.  More generally , input -
output analysis does not account for any of the substitution effects that would normally be expected 
as producers and consumers react to the reduced availability of the products affected by the trade 
 
 
40 The decomposition of elements of the principal scenario to sub -scenarios yields almost identical results to 
those that are obtained by separately considering each of the sub -scenarios as individual hypothetical 
extractions. For more on this , see Annex 8. 2.1.

  shock. Accordingly, the GDP declines reported in this chapter do not represent predictions as to what 
would be the  economic  impact of a disruption in OECD -MNOE  trade ― except perhaps in the very 
short term, i.e. before the expected market s adjustments would start occurring. This is an important 
consideration because these economic adjustments are sometimes u nexpectedly quick and large, as 
we have seen during the COVID -19 pandemic as well as with the economic impacts of Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine (e.g. in terms of substitution away from and towards supplies of Russian oil and 
natural gas).  The analysis of th e same scenario s using the OECD trade model METRO in Chapter  5 
accounts for such adjustments and generally presents smaller impacts.  
4.2. The effects of reducing bilateral  trade between OECD countries and MNOES  
4.2.1. Impacts on country GDP  
Figure  4.1 illustrates the  impact of a 10% reduction in all OECD -MNOE trade on the GDP of OECD 
countries. In each case, the total effect is decomposed to highlight the shares that can be attributed 
to a breakdown of trade between OECD countries and a specific MNOE country  and these  can be 
interpreted as representing the effects of sub -scenarios involving specific MNOEs . In the principal 
scenario, t aken together, OECD countries see their overall GDP decrease by 0.42%. That figure, 
however , masks a significant amount of inter -country variation. The Asia Pacific region is affected the 
most heavily, with Korea and Australia experiencing GDP losses of 1.37% and 1.20%, respectively. 
At the other end of the spectrum, North America is relatively u naffected, whereas Europe lies 
somewhere in between. Among European countries, it is Germany ( -0.56%) and the Netherlands  
(-0.56%) that are more exposed to the shock.  
In general, the main driver of these GDP reductions is the decrease in trade with China.  This is hardly 
surprising, given that China accounts for almost two -thirds of the MNOE’s overall trade with the OECD. 
The link with China is particularly strong for the countries of the Asia Pacific, where its reduction 
accounts for about four -fifths of t he overall impact of the OECD -MNOE trade shock. In the case of 
Europe, exposure to a disruption of trade with China is not as pronounced, but still significant. A 10% 
reduction in trade between the OECD countries and China is calculated to reduce GDP in th e EU27 
by about 0.26%.  In addition , several European countries (most obviously Poland) display non -
negligible ties to the economy of Russia. In this respect, however, it is important to keep in mind that 
that the data used in this analysis predate Russia’s  invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions.  
The impact of the trade shock on the GDPs of MNOEs is generally more pronounced than in OECD 
countries ( Figure 4.2 ). In the simplest terms, this appears to indicate that MNOEs are more 
economically dependent on trade with the OECD countries that the OECD countries are on trade with 
MNOEs. This is a consequence of the fact that trade with the OECD accounts for larger shares of the 
economies in MNOEs than trade with MNOEs does in OECD countries (Figure 4.3). Wit hin the MNOE 
group, however, different countries have stronger trade linkages with different geographical areas. 
South Africa and Russia seem most dependent on Europe, whilst China, India and Brazil have 
comparatively stronger links with North America. For  Indonesia, the key partners are those of  the Asia 
Pacific. Among all MNOEs, Russia is the country most affected by the trade shock, which reflects its 
high reliance on trade with OECD countries in Europe (prior to its aggression of Ukraine).

4.2.2. Decomposition of country GDP impacts by traded sector  
The effect of the OECD -MNOE trade shoc k on the GDP of a given country can be further decomposed 
to assess what weight is carried by products of different nature (primary, manufacturing or services) 
and destined to different uses ( intermediate or final).  The results (Figure 4.4) suggest markedl y 
different patterns of trade dependence across countries. For a big exporter of agricultural and mining 
products , like Australia for example, the impact of the shock can be attributed to a very significant 
extent (60%) to the disruption of trade (mainly e xports) of primary products. Similarly , the impact on 
Russia reflects the fact that its economy is dominated by trade (again, mostly exports) in energy 
minerals and related products. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa are also relatively sensitive to 
disru ptions of trade in primary products.  
By contrast, in a number of other countries the main channel through which the trade shock affects 
GDP is represented by manufactured products. The most notable cases are probably those of Korea 
and China, where a 10% r eduction in manufacturing trade between OECD and MNOEs leads to a 1% 
and a 0.76% drop in GDP, respectively. Even so, manufacturing accounts for a dominant share of the 
overall GDP impact of the OECD -MNOE trade shock in Italy (67%), Germany (65%) and Japan (62%) 
as well.  
Finally, in several OECD countries it is trade in services that represents the main source of 
dependency on MNOEs . In the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, for example, a 10% drop in 
the flow of services between the OECD and MNOEs  is calculated to reduce GDP by 0.33% and 0.20% 
respectively. Besides, although dwarfed by the impact through trade in manufactured products, the 
service s trade channel is still a very significant source of vulnerability in Korea as well. On the MNOEs 
side, dis ruptions of trade in services seem potentially serious for India.  
When a distinction is made between different destinations of traded products, China stands out in 
terms of the share of the impact accounted by the final demand channel (44%). The correspond ing 
figure for the OECD as whole is 30%. This means that more than for other countries, for China the 

          81  
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  dependence on trade with the OECD countries is mainly related to trade in final products41 and not 
inputs into production (either those that China itself uses for production or those that it provides to 
other global producers).  Within the OECD, the weight of the final product component tends to be lower 
for the countries of the Asia Pacific reg ion (25%) and higher in Europe (35% for the EU27), but  it is 
quite low for the Netherlands (29%).  
When these results are looked at together, a pattern emerges: the components of the OECD -MNOE 
trade shock that hurt a given country the most are often those t hat ― directly or indirectly ― cut off a 
significant part of its economy from an important export market. The most illustrative example is 
perhaps provided by Australia. In this case, net export of primary products to MNOEs account for as 
much as 8% of the  country’s overall GDP. Indeed, when trade in primary goods between the OECD 
and MNOEs  is reduced by 10%, the GDP of Australia experiences a sizable 0.72% drop. Similarly, 
Korea is found to be highly dependent on trade in manufacturing products, a sector i n which it enjoys 
a net export  position vis a vis MNOEs amounting to more than 5% of its overall GDP. While not always 
as clear cut, the pattern applies to several other cases that have been identified as important channels 
of trade dependence ( e.g. net ex ports of services to MNOEs  are responsible for almost 2% of the 
Neth erlands’ GDP, net exports of final manufactured products to the OECD add up to 3.3% of China’s 
GDP , etc. ). In a majority of cases, then, the trade dependencies uncovered appear to arise th rough 
forward rather than backward linkages42.

41 Recall that final products are destined for final consumption while intermediate products are inputs into 
production. The latter are combined with other inputs, transformed using labour and capital, and they are 
consumed only at later stages, embodie d in products destined for final consumption.  
42 This is a natural consequence of the methodological approach  adopted here. As mentioned in the introduction, 
built into the hypothetical extraction method is the assumption that production can continue withou t replacing the 
intermediate inputs lost to the trade shock.  Accordingly, the approach tends to place greater emphasis on forward 
rather than backward dependencies.

  4.2.3. Impacts across sectors  
In any given country, not all sectors of the economy are exposed to the considered  trade shock to the 
same degree. Figure 4.5 presents a summary view of  how much value added is exposed to trade 
disruptions in each country  at the industry level . Country by country, the boxplots display the 
distribution of the relative loss of value added associated with the shock over the 75 sectors that 
comprise the ICIO. The markers represent outliers, ind ustries that experience unusually large impacts.  
The range of variation across industries can be fairly wide. In other words, certain sectors of a country’s 
economy are typically significantly more exposed than others. The list of the most impacted  industr ies 
varies from one country to another, but it is fairly common to find the highest levels of exposure in the 
primary sector and, more specifically, in industries belonging to the mining and quarrying cluster.  This 
is because the trade shock constrains sev eral important flows of mineral resources between OECD 
and MNOEs . Australia, for example, sells more than four -fifths of its entire output of metal ores directly 
to China and until recently many European countries relied heavily on the Russian Federation f or their 
energy inputs. In addition, it is not uncommon for primary products to be indirectly re -exported as 
intermediate inputs embodied in other products.  
In several cases, the sectors identified as  the most heavily dependent on OECD -MNOE trade, 
represen t only small shares of their country’s economy. Italy’s metal ore industry, for instance, is 
severely affected by the shock but makes a negligibly small contribution to the country’s GDP. A similar 
conclusion holds for Spain as well.  
On the other hand, the  list of outliers also includes industries of great significance from both a domestic 
and a global point of view. Most notably, it includes the electronics sector in Korea (where it is 
responsible for 7% of the country’s GDP), China (2.5%) and Japan (1.5%) . In the same vein, a 
reduction of trade with OECD countries would also do significant damage to India’s large IT services 
sector (3.4% of GDP).

Note: The boxplot for any given country summari ses the distribution of the percent change in value added in the 75 industries that make 
up that country’s  economy. The lower and upper lines delimiting the box identify the first quartile (bottom  25% of observations) and third 
quartile (top 25%), respectively. The horizontal bar in the box represents the median. The vertical lines stretching out from  the box 
represent the minimum and maximum values disregarding outliers. Outliers are represented a s dots in the picture. The shape and colo ur 
of the marker characterize the type of sector. Outliers of particular interest are also identified by labels.

  4.2.4. Impacts in the European Union  and the Netherlands  
This section  consider s the impact of the OECD -MNOE  shock on the economy of the  European Union 
(EU27 ) as a whole. For each industry of the input -output system, Figure  4.6 plots the value added loss 
associated with the trade shock against its share of the EU's GDP. Exposure to trade with MNOEs  
appears comparatively high in important manufacturing sectors like machinery, chemicals and 
electronics, which experience value added  declines between 1% and 2%. At the same time, large 
service sectors, such as construction, healthcare, education and social services, are linked 
predominantly to domestic users and appear to be fairly isolated from the trade shock. Conversely, 
services in dustries with a close connection to trade ( e.g. transport and wholesaling) tend to experience 
above -average declines in value added  and this is important for economies such as that of the 
Netherlands where transport and logistical services are important co ntributors to GDP.  The chart in 
Annex 8.2.1 further breaks down the impacts displayed in Figure 4.6 to highlight the contribution of 
MNOE s. Not surprisingly, China usually represents the dominant component, but India, Russia and 
Brazil collectively account  for significant shares of the impact in several industries (e.g. Water 
transport, Chemicals, Machinery, Air transport, Iron and stee l).

Zooming in on the results for the Netherlands, Figure 4.7 displays the impacts of the trade shock at 
the industry level along with a decomposition to gauge th e significance of the linkages with individual 
MNOE countries. Although the largest dependencies are observed in sectors that are comparatively 
small in the context of the Dutch economy (postal and courier services, mining services), several 
sizable sector s also show non -negligible losses of value added (legal and IT services, but also 
chemicals, machinery and security services). In many cases it is the linkages with China that represent 
the main source of exposure to MNOEs  (e.g. postal and courier services , other utilities), but several  
Dutch industries also appear to  have close links with Brazil ( security services and rental services)  and 
some with Indonesia ( shipbuilding, wood).   
Interestingly, exposures are relatively high not only across the manufacturi ng industries, but also for 
several types of services which account also for significant shares of GDP ( e.g. legal services, IT 
services  and, to a lesser extent, wholesale trade ). These services , which are affected by the trade 
shock , account also for relatively significant shares of the Netherlands’ GDP ( e.g. legal services, IT 
services, wholesale trade and shipping and transport services).

  4.2.5. Focus on backward linkages  
By and large, the results of the hypothetical extraction analysis reflect the reciprocal significance of OECD 
countries and MNOEs  as each other ’s export markets. In other words, our results so far have emphasi sed 
how the two groups of cou ntries are tied by a network of important forward linkages. On the other hand, 
not much could be said on  the backward dependency aspects of those relationships. To a large extent, 
this stems from  characteristics of the adopted methodological approach. As noted in the introduction, the 
hypothetical extraction method contains the implicit assumption that the intermediate inputs made 
unavailable by the trade shock need not be replaced.  Such a framework, in which it is possible for 
production to continue unaffe cted in spite of an input becoming unavailable, does  not to give due justice 
to the importance of  backward dependencies. Accordingly, this section complements the hypothetical 
extraction results with an analysis of backward linkages.  
Figure 4.8 represents the use of intermediate inputs sourced by selected OECD economies from MNOEs  
per unit of output. For example, for each USD worth of output it produces , the Korean economy requires 
USD  0.18 worth of inputs produced in MNOEs.  Referred to in some o f the recent literature on trade 
dependencies as ‘foreign input reliance’ indicator (e.g.  Baldwin and Freeman  (2022 [26]), this measure refers 
not only to the inputs from MNOEs  that are used directl y in Korea’s production processes, but also to those 
that are used indirectly in the production of the inputs to those production processes. Equivalently, the 
dependence measures in  Figure 4.8. refer to total backward linkages  (that is the reliance on fore ign 
intermediate inputs of the whole economy . Backward linkages to MNOEs  are particularly high for Korea 
and, to a lesser degree, Poland. In all cases, the main contribution to dependency on MNOEs comes from 
trade with China. For several European countries  (most clearly for Poland), Russia also appears to be an 
important source of inputs. Once again, however, the data are quite likely outdated in this respect. Finally, 
Australia displays non -negligible backward linkages to India.  
Figure  4.8. Sourcing of intermediate inputs from MNOEs  by OECD countries  
 
Source: OECD calculations based  on OECD ICIO data.  
Compared with the results in  Figure  4.8, the MNOEs backward linkages to OECD countries ( Figure  4.9) 
tend to be relatively high. Europe is a significant source of intermediate inputs for all MNOEs , but more so 
for South Africa and, subject to the usual caveats, Russia . China, on the other hand, is comparatively more 
dependent on OECD economies of Asia P acific . 
Taking a closer look at the economy of the EU27 as a whole (Figure  4.10), we see important dependencies 
on China and, albeit to a lesser extent, on Russia. Dependencies on China are most prominent in the 
manufacturing industries such as electronics , shipbuilding and electrical equipment. The dependencies on 
Russia, on the other hand, are all connected to natural resources. They are found in extraction activities 
themselves (oil and gas, metal ores, mining services), in the energy sector and related processing activities 
(coke and petroleum), as well as in energy intensive industries (iron and steel, non -ferrous metals). When

4.3. Conclusions from the ICIO analysis  
This chapter has analysed the vulnerability of a selection of large economies to a pot ential disruption of 
trade between OECD and MNOE countries through the lens of input -output analysis, using the OECD TIVA 
data and the hypothetical  extraction method to assess the potential implications of 10% reduction in all 
OECD -MNOE trade flows.  
At a b road level, trade disruptions of this kind are found to hurt the GDP of MNOEs  more than that of OECD 
countries. This is simply because the trade flows being suppressed represent a larger share of the 
economy in the former than in the latter. Among the OECD  countries, the most exposed are those of the 
Asia Pacific region: their economies display very high levels of integration with China, which is by far the 
largest of MNOEs  by any metric of trade. Australia’s primary sector and Korea’s manufacturing appear 
particularly vulnerable. Still, a disruption of OECD -MNOE trade would also have severe repercussions in 
China’s manufacturing sector, whose production is to a very significant degree destined to final consumers 
in the OECD. Unsurprisingly, the electronics industries of Korea, China and Japan are found to be 
particularly dependent on OECD -MNOE trade.  
While not as high as that of the Asia Pacific, Europe’s degree of dependency on trade with MNOEs  is still 
far from negligible and significantly more pronounced than for North America. Keeping in mind that the 
results of the hypothetical extraction should be interpreted with caution43, we find that a 10% reduction in 
trade between the OECD and MNOEs  is associated with an almost half percentage point drop in the GDP 
of the EU27. Within Europe, it is Germany and the Netherlands that exhibit the most significant 
 
 
43 As noted in the introduction of this chapter, the methodology does not account for any of  the adjustments that would 
take place in the economic system following a trade shock  of this kind. Accordingly, the results represent an 
assessment of the broader economic significance of the trade links suppressed, but not an attempt to predict the 
conse quences of the shock – especially not beyond the very short run.  Ultimately, the calculated GDP losses should 
be interpreted as measures of the size of the exposure to disruptions , but the a ctual losses  would be  higher or lower 
depending on substitutability of inputs or in consumer  markets.

  dependencies. In the former, they arise predominantly through trade in manufactured products, in the latter 
through trade in services. Especially in the case of the Netherlands, exposure is not limited to China and 
significant linkages with the other  MNOEs  (e.g. Brazil) are also observed.  
Due to assumptions of the employed methodology, t he trade de pendencies that emerged from this analysis 
stem mainly from forward linkages. In other words, the results of hypothetical extraction tend to highlight 
cases in which the OECD -MNOE shock separates producers in one group of countries from important 
(direct o r indirect) export markets in the other group. This certainly underestimates the overall significance  
of trade dependencies. Nevertheless, these relatively conservative estimates show already that reliance 
on imported raw materials and other imported inter mediates is not the only  — or may even not be the main  
— aspect  to consider. This puts into context  the ongoing policy debate which seems to be predominantly  
concerned with import dependencies . It is in this context  the final part of the chapter has extend ed the 
analysis to the backward linkages between OECD and MNOEs . Once again, the results show evidence of 
the high degree of economic integration between the two groups of countries (and especially between 
OECD countries and China) and i llustrates some of the economic costs that may be involved in the 
currently debated  strategies of ‘ de-risking ’ supply chains . 
5. Modelling trade dependencies using the OECD CGE model METRO  
The I nter-Country Input-Output (ICIO)  approach pursued in the previous chapter  keeps prices fixed and 
does not allow for any adjustment , through trade  or in domestic product and factor markets , to cushion the 
impacts of trade disruptions. Th e ICIO approach can thus be considered as portraying short -term impacts 
when typical economic  adjustments have not yet occurred.  
The global computable general equilibrium ( CGE ) model  approach used in this chapter relaxes these 
rigidities to gauge the impacts in the medium term, when adjustments can take place . Allowing for 
adjustments in the sour cing of inputs, the re -balancing of product markets as well markets for different 
kinds of labour and capital , enable a more comprehensive picture of possible  economic impacts to be 
drawn.  
This analysis uses the OECD global CGE trade model METRO to assess  the impacts on selected 
economies of the same 10% trade reduction scenario  between the OECD and MNOE countries .  
5.1. Introduction  
As discussed in Chapter  2, trade dependencies are usually defined as trade links that are potentially  more 
prone to disruptions ( the notion of risk), for which substitution towards other suppliers or to other  equivalent  
products is difficult (the notion of substitution/diversification) , and which are economically important from 
the country’s point of view (the notion of economic imp ortance).  The OECD global economy CGE trade 
model METRO , which is  used to shed further light on trade dependencies in  this chapter , allows better 
integrating the  latter two  dimension s in one quantitative framework  while also providing a consistent 
framework for a systematic analysis of possible risks  and their consequences .44 
The main characteristics of the METRO model are summarised in Annex 8.3. The main characteristics of  
supply chain  integration  identified in the literature on GVC integration and as measured in the OECD’s 
ICIO tables and TiVA  methodology used in Chapter  4 are accounted for in the model and its associated 
database . For example, the model can be used to calculate the foreign content  of gross exports (i.e. a 
measure of ‘backward’ GVC participation) or domestic value added content in other countries gross exports 
(‘forward” GVC participation) in the baseline and in analytical scenarios.  Therefore, s imilar  to the 
hypothetical extraction methodology used  in Chapter  4, the model allow s the incorporation of a supply 
 
 
44 An on -going OECD work uses the same model and a similar database aggregation to study the question of 
how different shocks propagate across the global economy (see Arriola, Kowalski and van Tongeren 
(forthcoming 31) in a highly interlinked global economy ). 
   89

  chain perspective on trade dependencies  and tracking where value is generated and where and how it is 
used .  
In addition , through  explicitly modelling eco nomic behaviour  of producers and consumers  located in 
different countries , as well as international trade links  connecting the m, the model  allows for a more realistic 
assessment of  adjustments  to potential disruptions . The size of the simulated impacts on value added and 
GDP is typically smaller than those coming from the ICIO analysis since the CGE model allows for 
adjustments (substitution) in both sourcing and sales in response to a given trade disruption.   
For example, in response to a disruption in the supply of a specific  intermediate product  sourced from a 
foreign location , producers  in a certain economic sector  may, first,  try to replace the foreign inputs with 
inputs from domestic sources, try sourcing a similar  input  from alternative foreign source s, or attempt to 
substitut e it with other inputs used in production, for example, with larger amounts of labour or capital.  In 
the model, the ease of these substitutions is determined by an interplay of data reflecting the actual 
economic production structures of trading sectors and countries (e.g. shares of alternative sources of 
intermediates or shares of different factors o f product ion in the value added of the sector) and parameters 
(e.g. elasticities of substitution and other parameters used in the model).  If these alternative ways of 
producing are economically viable  (e.g. because the elasticity of substitution between th e different source 
countries is high  and alternative sources can be found ) the sector’s producer s may not have to significantly 
reduce its output or revenue which would suggest that the sector is in fact not ‘trade dependent ’. Similar 
substitutions are mod elled for final products. Note also that in this model the adjustments to disruptions go 
beyond the actors immediately involved in the disrupted  trade links . In particular, in reaction to trade 
disruptions a part of trade is expected to be diverted to thir d partners and  possibly  benefit them 
economically.  Lastly, t rade shocks will also have indirect effects in the rest of domestic economy which are 
connected through domestic factor markets and adjustments related to incomes and expenditures.  The 
interlinkag es embedded in the model allows for the identification of trade dependences that affect multiple 
sectors and therefore might have an economy wide impact.  
The model is set up so as to account for adjustments that occur in medium term where prices adjust in line 
with the underlying elasticities so as to equilibrate demand and supply for products, and production factors 
are perfectly mobile across sectors to equilibrate the associated demand for and supply of production 
factors, but the overall endowment of la bour and capital remain fixed and do not move across national 
economies . Normally , such a set-up is understood to correspond to adjustments that typically take up 
between five and ten years.   
Another attractive feature of the modelling approach at hand is that it integrates all the economic activities 
and linkages between them in one consistent macroeconomic accounting framework. This allows 
assessing the economic significance of trade linkages not only at the level of a sector or product but also 
at a leve l of a country. This may be helpful in distinguishing between macroeconomically insignificant (but 
possibly otherwise significant) and macroeconomically significant trade dependencies.  
Like with all models, there are also some limitations to keep in mind  and s ome of them are particularly 
relevant for the study of trade dependencies.   
First, while the model has a relatively high degree of sector disaggregation for this class of models, it is at 
the level of broad sector rather than the more specific product  level that was considered in Chapter  3. The 
level of aggregation is also  somewhat  higher than that  used  in the ICIO analysis in Chapter  4. 
Consequently , while adjustments are explicitly modelled this is performed at the relatively high level of 
aggregation . Therefore, while the approach  should capture  well average effects in broad sectors, it  may 
overlook  the dependencies that exist for more specific products.  This may be problematic if in reality there 
is a lot of heterogeneity within the broade r sector . For example, different raw materials which may be 
critical inputs into production in different industrial sectors are aggregated together, which may result in a 
possible overestimation of a possibility of substitution for alternatives. However, i f signs of dependency are 
detected in the analysis conducted at the broad sector level, this suggest that at least some of the more 
specific activities or products that are covered by this category, may be trade dependent.  The analysis 
should therefore not  be seen as exhaustive but as a first filter for identifying those broad economic sectors 
which can be studied in detail using methodologies allowing for more product detail.  
Another limitation is that technology is assumed not to  change in response to pri ce signals  and intermediate 
inputs are used in fixed shares in the production of a product . In contrast to the aggregation problem, this 
may in turn result in an overestimation of the economic significance of reliance on certain intermediate 
90    
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  inputs. Finall y, in this type of models, economic trade links which are insignificant in the baseline cannot 
be created or easily expanded (unless they concern products characterised by  some trading activity and 
very high elasticities).  
5.2. The effects of reducing bilateral  trade between OECD countries and MNOEs  
The main scenario considered in the CGE analysis45 is the same as the one applied in Chapter  4, 
specifically  a 10% reduction (in real terms) of bilateral trade across all sectors between the individual 
member countri es of the OECD and each country in the MNOE group .46 Similar to the results from the ICIO 
analysis, in the CGE modelling exercise, countries in the two groups lose from the 10% reduction of trade 
between the two groups , although, as expected, the impacts obtained from the CGE analysis tend to be 
smaller  since firms are able to respond to disruptions by finding alternative sources for inputs and markets 
for outpu t to try to mitigate any negative effects . 
5.2.1. Real GDP changes  
At the macro level, f ew countries benefit from reduced trade between OECD and MNOEs (Figure 5.1 
Panel  A). Aside from the United States, which experiences an increase in real GDP, all countries in the 
OECD and MNOE groups experience a fall in real GDP . Korea and Australia are the most negatively 
impacted among OECD countr ies losing close to a 10th of a per  cent of GDP.  Both countries have relatively 
strong forward and backward supply chain and final  products linkages with MNOEs , particularly China as 
well as Indonesia and India. The Netherlands is the most negatively affected among EU countries , and 
this is  driven by relatively large r declines in the value  added  output in the services sectors . Value added  in 
services sectors decline -0.1%. While small relative to the increase in value added in Dutch primary and 
manufacturing industries. Services sectors account for over 80% of the value added . The US experiences 
a very small  increase in real GDP  because the negative effects of reducing inputs from MNOEs  are 
outweighed by market gains domestically and abroad especially in markets of  OECD partners who also 
cut supplies fr om MNOEs  and where the US is in a strong position to compete. Canada, and Mexi co fare 
better than most OECD countries  because of integrated international supply chains and strong trade 
linkages within North America, in particular with the US . These linkages are further  strengthened when 
each OECD country located in North America and other regions reduces trade with MNOEs .  
In general, OECD countries with stronger trade linkages with MNOEs rather than the OECD fare worse 
when OECD regions reduce imports and exports with MNOEs ( Figure 5.2 Panel A). This is the case for  
Australia and Korea and is in line with the results of input -output analysis presented in Chapter  4. Stronger 
linkages within the OECD help mitigate the negative effects of trade reduction with MNOEs (Figure 5.2 
Panel B).  
Australia and Korea have stronge r trade linkages with MNOEs compared to other OECD countries and are 
therefore the most negatively affected by reduced trade with the group. Many sectors in Korea and 
Australia rely heavily on MNOEs as export markets, particularly China. Australia exports 77% of mining 
products and over a third of its metals to China. Similarly, half of Korean electronics and 45% of chemicals 
are exported to China. The model results suggest that when Australia and Korea reduce trade with MNOEs, 
they fail to find enough alte rnative markets for their exports to make up for the losses even when other 
OECD countries  reduce imports from MNOEs and thus have the potential to source more from OECD 
partners . Real exports decline around 3% for both of these countries which is roughly ten times larger than 
for most other OECD countries.  
 
 
45 See Annex section 8. 3.2 for a detailed descriptions of the METRO model scenarios . 
46 Note , however , that the country and sector aggregation while as similar as possible, differs slightly between these 
approaches and therefore not all results may be directly comparable.

there is an increase  in export demand among alternative trade partners. Intra -EU trade fills in the gap, 
albeit incompletely as total real exports and imports still decline  somewhat in the EU region as a whole

  The real GDP of the  Netherlands decreases the most among all the EU countries included  in the model  
(-0.07%)  ― driven mainly by output declines in a number of  services sect or where relatively large shares 
of labour is employed. The fall in output in the services sectors translates to deeper factor and subsequent 
household income declines than in other EU regions  (Figure 5.4 ). Household income in the Netherlands 
falls -0.46% but only  -0.32% in the EU26 region on average . 
The North  American region is least affected by the reduced trade scenario. The economy of the United 
States records a small gain and the economies of Mexico and Canada record some of the least negative 
impacts a mong the OECD countries. Despite relatively stronger trade links with MNOEs compared to other 
OECD regions, the US economy does not decline because it benefits both from import substitution and 
from re -rerouting of trade flows triggered by the considered s cenario. The is illustrated by increases of 
output in United States’ manufacturing sectors where  MNOEs initially make up a large share of its imports. 
The increases in output are driven by both increased domestic and export demand. OECD partners 
reducing t heir imports from MNOEs results in an increased demand for US exports of electronics , textiles  
and wearing apparel , and steel ( ferrous metals ). The net effect is an improvement in the US trade balance 
which underpins the small but positive real GDP change.  Moreover, the increase in import demand in the 
US from non -MNOE partners is met predominantly by Mexico and Canada as illustrated by the fact that 
they are the only two OECD countries with an increase in real exports in the scenario.  
MNOEs are also negat ive affected when they reduce trade with OECD countries (Figure 5.1). Real GDP 
in Russia, China, and Brazil decline the most among MNOE countries as they are the regions who rely 
more heavily on OECD export  markets and import supply compared to the other c ountries in the MNOE 
group. Around three quarters or more of imports into MNOE countries of pharmaceuticals , motor vehicles , 
communications , and financial and insurance services  come from OECD countries. And for many of these 
sectors, OECD is the main source (accounts for 80% of imports) for the three most impacted MNOE 
countries. On the export side, the OECD market is an important destination overall for China and Russia 
in the baseline database (2017), but in certain sectors the OECD region is a key export market particularly 
for Indonesian textiles  and wearing apparel , Russian  petroleum and coal as well as metals sector , and 
business  and communication  services  exports from Indi a and other manufacturing and financial  services  
from China to name a few. Reductions in import and export to and from important trading partners has a 
negative impact on MNOE economies.

5.2.2. Impact on sectoral output in the OECD  
The real GDP changes  discussed above mask considerable differences in sectoral output changes which 
are due to both the nature of the considered trade shock as well as the underlying trade speci alisation 
patterns. With few exceptions , production declines in most sectors in th e OECD  as a whole  are driven 
mainly by reductions in export demand which  range from -0.004% in the other manufacturing  sector to 4% 
for the mining  sector  (Figure 5.5 Panel A) . Production in the textile and wearing apparel , electronics 
equipment , other manufacturing  and mineral  sectors is helped by both an increase in domestic demand 
and an increase in intra -OECD trade when  OECD trade with  MNOEs is reduced . 
The mining , motor vehicles , and chemicals sectors are hit the hardest (Annex  Table 8.2 ) and the de clines 
are driven largely by the reduction in export demand.  The fall in mining  sector output is predominantly 
accounted for by the changes in mining production in Australia , where about half of its exports are destined 
for China . The decline in total prod uction in the OECD region of motor vehicles and parts  are more 
widespread.  Main OECD producers of this sector (United States , Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, 
Germany, France, and rest of EU) see production declines of about 1% or less. Similarly , in the chemical s 
sector, production declines across most OECD regions with the sharpest declines observed in Korea  
(-3%), Germany ( -1%), and Japan ( -1%). 
Total o utput declines in the EU are smaller than the total decline in the OECD as a whole.  In the EU , the 
fall in output by sectors  range from -0.02% in the ferrous metals  sector to -0.76% in the motor vehicles and 
parts  sector. Small increases in output  are seen in the government  sector (public administration, defense, 
education, and health an d human services), agriculture , other manufacturing , coal, oil and gas extraction , 
electronic equipment  and textile and wearing apparel . Production increases range from 0.02% 
(government sector ) to 2.0% ( textile and wearing apparel ) (Figure 5.5 Panel B ). Much of the output 
changes are driven by the changes in export demand  but adjustments in the domestic factor and product 
markets as well as income effects are likely driving the changes in the government  sector and less traded 
services . 
The motor vehicles and parts , metals  and metal products , and basic pharmaceuticals , are the sectors with 
the strongest declines in output. France, Germany, and Sweden see the largest decline in motor vehicle 
production in relative terms ( -1.1%, -1.0%, and -0.8% respectively ). The rest of EU, accounts for almost all 
the decline in metals  and metal products  within the EU27 region. Sweden records the largest decline in 
basic pharmaceutical  production in relative  terms ( -2%), but most of the decline in the EU27 region is 
accounted for by the rest of EU, Germany, France, and Italy.

  Total output in the Netherlands declines 0.13% , but due to strong increases in output of certain industries 
the average output change across the different sectors is slightly positive (0.15%). Transport services , 
chemicals , and other services  see the strongest declines which range from -0.8% ( transport services ) to -
0.1% ( trade ) (Figure 5.5 Panel C ). Production declines in all but one services sectors, utilities , with output 
in the transport services  falling the most as reductions in world trade reduces the demand for shipping and 
transport services. Sectors  with strong production increases see an increase in both export and domestic 
demand with generally a stronger demand in exports ― the exception being electronic equipment  and 
coal, oil and gas  where in the latter domestic demand plays a larger role.  
5.2.3 Impact on sectoral output in China and other MNOEs  
Reduce d trade between OECD and MNOEs also has a negative impact across most sectors in China as 
well as in the other MNOE regions which highlight s the fact  that dependencies go in both directions . 
Manufacturing sectors in China particularly  textiles and wearing apparel , electronic equipment and other 
manufacturing  are affected the most declining between 1.5 % and 2.7 % in the simulation ( Figure 5.6 
Panel  A). These sectors also seem to be the most dependent on the EU27 compared to other sectors as 
reduction of trade between MNOEs and EU27 adds about half a percentage point to the decline.

  Total output changes in the other MNOE region show a similar pattern. Output in many sectors  decline, 
but the mix of most impacted sectors differ from those in China reflecting the heterogeneity in the industrial 
structure of the MNOE region as a whole. In  addition to textile and wearing apparels, primary sectors such 
as petroleum and oil  as well as coal, oil and gas extraction  also experience a decline in production in the 
MNOE region aggregate that does not include China (Figure 5.6 Panel B) . Busines s ser vices  is among the 
top three of the most affected sectors for the other MNOE group, where India accounts for most of the 
decline (Annex Table 8.2). Dependence with the EU27 is also notably stronger among the other MNOE 
region than with China.  
5.2.4 Indust ry exposure to OECD trade reduction with China  
Supply chain disruptions during COVID -19 exposed the potential vulnerability of global value chains to 
bottlenecks and supply failures  related to an industry’s dependency o n a limited number of suppliers. 
China’s dominance and importance in global supply chains  makes a convincing case for  exami ning an 
industry ’s exposure to reduced trade with China  and how a supply disruption could affect its output . Using 
an additional set pf trade scenario s where each of the OECD countries is assumed to reduce  by 10% trade 
only with China  (or any other individual member of the MNOE grouping) , it is possible to identify which 
sectors in which regions are more exposed  to trade with China  (or, equivalently, any other individual 
member of the MNOE grouping) . 
The exposure of sectoral output to Chinese trade differs across regions and sectors  (Figure (5.7). For the 
OECD region  as a whole , reduce d trade with China drives the output changes in many sectors particularly 
those with the largest changes  ― mining , motor vehicles , electronics equipment , and textiles  and wearing 
apparel . Similarly, f or the European Union and the Netherlands, many sectors are also exposed to trade 
with China,  including motor vehicles , electronics eq uipment , and textiles and wearing apparel  but also the 
food and beverage sector . However, for some industries other MNOEs  are also relevant – for example the  
mining  sector, where Brazil is an important trading partner of the EU. In the Netherlands, other MNOEs  
are important in sectors like  petroleum and coal  and utilities  (which includes electricity and the distribution 
of manufactured gas through pipelines) where Ru ssia is an important supplier  and the chemicals  sectors 
where the share of total imports from Indonesia, India and Russia account for account for as much as the 
imports from China  at base levels (the starting point of the simulation) . 
For certain key secto rs such as m otor vehicles and electronics equip , exposure to China drives some , if 
not most , of the output changes. Supply failures or other market shocks in these sectors could have 
economy -wide implications should trade with China be reduced.

5.2.3. Exposure to OECD trade reduction with China of ‘strategic’ sectors  
This section identifies the sectors that are most exposed to reductions in trade of key commodities between 
the OECD and China. By running different scenarios that reduce trade between the two regions  in only 
one specific ‘strategic’ sector  at a time , it is possible to decompose the effects of each sector scenario on 
an industry’s production.  
This analysis focuses on ‘strategic ’ sectors which are defined similarly to strategic products in the detailed 
trade data analysis in Chapter  3.47 The analysis focuses on s ectors such as chemicals , electronic 
equipment , motor vehicles , mineral product s, other manufacturing  and attempts to ascertain how changes 
 
 
47 The def inition  of strategic sectors  in the analysis of Chapter  5 is based on strate gic manufacturing sector (ISIC Rev 
4 definition) identified in the World Econ omic Outlook, April 2023: A Rocky Recovery (imf.org)  (IMF, 2023 [18]). The ISIC 
Rev 4 codes are then mapped to GTAP sectors using an HS 6-digit codes correspondence as an intermediary  step 
(and the HS codes used here are the same as the ones used for defining strategic products in Chapter  3). Non -energy 
GTAP sectors where a t least 25% of corresponding HS6 codes were mapped to a strategic ISIC rev 4 code were 
selected for this exercise. Other manufacturing was also included despite not meeting this threshold.

  in the trade of one of these strategic sector s might affect the pr oduction of others. Using these scenarios 
in conjunction with the main scenario of trade reduction of all sectors between OECD and MNOEs  as well 
as OECD and China we can identify how much of the production change can be attributed to changes in 
trade of a strategic sector with China versus other sectors or other MNOE  partners. Moreover, by scaling 
the proportion of change attributed to each simulation to 100 for all sectors, it is possible to compare the 
relative exposure of each industry to a given strateg ic sector. This decomposition is presented if Figure  5.8 
for the OECD  (Panel A) , as well as for the EU 27 and the Netherlands (Panel s B and C  respectively).

Not surprisingly the direct effect of reducing trade of a strategic sector accounts for the largest share of 
change  in that sector , be it positive or negative  (within the OECD as well as the EU27 region) . OECD 
reducing trade with China of mineral products, other manufacturing, and electronics equipment increase 
production in each sector respectively  due to increase in both domestic and export demand (as in mineral  
products  and other manufacturing ) or increases domestic consumption ( electronics sectors ). Reducing 
chemicals  and motor vehicles  trade with China has negative effects on those sectors due to both reduced 
domes tic and export demand.  
Among the five different strategic sectors, OECD reducing electronic s, motor vehicles , and other 
manufacturing  trade with China has a more widespread affect across other industries compared to more 
upstream sectors such as chemicals  and minerals  which have more specialised uses – e.g. chemicals are 
used in the petroleum and coal sector, but not necessarily in hospitality, or at least not to the same extent. 
This is true within the OECD as a whole as well as the EU27.  
For the Netherlan ds, the direct effect of reducing trade with China of a strategic sector accounts for the 
largest share of the change in output of that industry as was found to be the case of for the OECD as a 
whole and for EU27 (Figure 5.8 Panel C ). OECD reducing trade i n the electronics equipment  and the other 
manufacturing  industry with other MNOEs accounts for almost all the increase in production of those 
sectors. The exception is for the chemicals  sector, where Indonesia, Russia, and India are also important 
sources of imports in addition to China. While the production of motor vehicles and parts  sector in the 
Netherlands is predominantly affected by the reduction of the sector with China, it is al so negative impacted 
by the reduction trade with China of electronics equipment . In fact, the reduction in electronics equipment  
trade with China (yellow bars in the chart) has negative impact across most sectors, except the industry 
itself, where less tra de with China increases Dutch production in this sector. Reductions in trade of other 
manufacturing  with China (purple bars) affects a larger set of industries compared to the minerals or 
chemicals sectors.

the largest share of the output change in the industry, the table includes only indirect effects.

  Several observations can be made. The indirect sectoral exposure to the five different strategic sectors is 
not as prevalent in the Neth erlands as it is in the EU as a whole  (Table 5.1) . More Dutch industries are 
exposed to reduce d trade of electronics equipment  than the other four strategic sectors (positively or 
negatively). Most of the s ectors not affected by trade reductions in electro nics equipment  from China  are 
in more upstream industries ( agriculture , mineral and oil extraction , food and beverages  and textiles  and 
wearing apparel  to name a few). Dutch s ectors exposed to trade with China in products of the  other 
manufacturing are almost all  negatively affected. Production declines concerns  several services sectors 
(trade , hospital , transport services , and government services ). 
5.3 Conclusions from the CGE analysis  
This chapter uses the OECD CGE trade model METRO to assess the impact o f reducing trade between 
the countries in the OECD and several major non -OECD economies (MNOE). Similar to ICIO analysis of 
the previous chapter , a 10% reduction in all trade flows between countries in the two groupings is applied. 
The CGE approach complem ents the ICIO analysis by extending the analytical time frame in order to 
analyse the economic impact over the medium  term allowing time for product and factor markets to adjust, 
and substitution of intermediate inputs and output markets to have occurred. As such the magnitude of the 
impact in the CGE analysis is not as strong. Nonetheless, the two approaches generally dr aw the same 
conclusion that OECD and MNOE countries do not benefit from the scenario,  and they give broadly similar 
rankings of the most and least affected countries . 
At a macro level, the range of the impacts on real GDP vary across regions with few count ries benefiting 
from the reduced trade scenario. OECD countries with stronger trade linkages with MNOEs , particularly 
those in the Asia and Pacific region , are affected the most negatively among OECD countries . OECD 
countries in North America are significa ntly less affected due to less direct exposure to MNOEs and to 
market gains domestically and abroad especially as OECD partners re place supplies from MNOEs. EU 
countries are moderately affected by the trade reduction, with Germany and the Netherlands relat ively 
more exposed than other EU Members . The MNOE countries  tend to be affected even more negatively 
and Russia and China are among the most adversely affected countries across all regions due to their 
dependence on OECD markets and inputs.  
The trade exp osure of sectors within each region also varies due to the nature of the trade relationship 
between regions as well as each country’s trade specialisation. With a few exceptions, production declines 
in most sectors in the OECD as a whole are driven mainly by reductions in export demand with mining , 
motor vehicles , and chemicals  sectors as the hardest hit sectors. Production in some sectors in the OECD 
region increase, namely the textile and wearing apparel , electronics equipment , other manufacturing  and 
mineral sectors, helped by both by import substitution as well as an increase in intra -OECD trade when 
OECD trade with MNOEs is reduced.  However, these sectoral output gains should be seen in the context 
of economy -wide effects which are negative for most OEC D countries.  
Reduced trade between the two groupings also has a negative impact across most sectors in China and 
in the other MNOE countries  highlighting the fact that trade dependencies go in both directions. 
Manufacturing sectors in China particularly those which see an increase in intra -OECD trade ( textiles and 
wearing apparel , electronic equipment  and other manufacturing ) are hit the harde st. Output declines are 
also detected in many sectors of the other MN OEs, but the rankings of sectoral affects differ reflecting the 
heterogeneity in the industrial structure s within this country group.  
Moreover, reductions in trade with China in key secto rs can have spillover  effects in other sectors of the 
economy and the exposures to different key sectors are not equal. For example, reducing trade with China 
in electronics , motor vehicles , and other manufacturing  products has a more widespread effect across 
other industries compared to trade in  products of more upstream sectors such as chemicals  and minerals  
which have more specialised uses.  This is true within the OECD as a whole as well as the EU27. For some 
sectors in so me regions there is more exposure to trade with other MNOE s. For example, in the Dutch 
chemicals sector , Indonesia, Russia, and India are also important sources of imports in addition to China.  
The CGE results illustrate the  mutual nature of trade . Reducin g trade flows between  the countries in the 
OECD and MNOE groupings  exhibits economic cost s even in the medium term . Some of the negative 
effects of decreased access to intermediate inputs and markets are mitigate by increase intra -OECD trade 
but not enough  to eliminate a decline in overall or sectoral output.  
   103 
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  6. Conclusions and implications  
The results of this analysis illustrate some of the concerns that lie beneath the debate in on trade 
dependencies  in the context of increasingly uncertain global economic a nd geopolitical environments . As 
documented in this report, global production of products has become increasingly concentrated, and it 
tends to be increasingly clustered around some countries and regions, notably China and Asia. This is not 
only due to natural or organic economic factors, such as natural endowments, comparative advantage, 
economies of scale , or GVC fragmentation, but also policies. Whichever is the principal source of growing 
concentration, shocks related to climate change , changes in ec onomic policy or geopolitical conflicts, 
arguably have a higher potential to disrupt commercial links and caus e economic or societal damage  now 
than they had in the past. There is also more potential for trade to be used as a tool of economic coercion . 
Having said that, the evidence presented also shows that large, if not dominant, portions of global and 
national trade are relatively well diversified overall, and that international product markets are characterised 
by a fair amount of competition and limite d control over supply or price formation of specific importers or 
exporters. It is difficult to distinguish those concentrated trade links that could cause problems from 
advantageous trade linkages. C oncern s that policy responses which aim to minimise trad e risks and 
improve supply chain resilience may not be well designed  and may  unnecessarily undermine the benefits 
of international trade  are therefore legitimate.  
Countries  typically source their imports from —and ship their exports to —fewer partners than i s in principle 
globally possible . This reflects a combination of natural factors, such as the role of geography and trade 
costs , but also national  preferences and policies. There is thus untapped potential in using international 
markets to diversify. In fa ct, our findings suggest that a significant number of  OECD countries have been 
able to take advantage of diversification possibilities offered by international markets, as testified, for 
example , by declining average rates of import concentrations and bila teral import dependencies.  In this 
sense, trade dependency does not seem to be a generalised phenomenon,  but it is rather constrained to 
some specific countries and products.  
Which trading partners are the main counterparts in the highly concentrated trade  linkages has indeed 
been raised as one of the key issues in the trade dependency  debate. This is a legitimate approach 
because geographic, economic  and geopolitical  risks are often related to the country  affiliation or location 
of trading partners. Here, too, some of our findings support a cautious approach to concentrated trade 
relations, while others are more reassuring . 
Dependency on China  has increased significantly across all OECD regions since the late 1990s  and the 
country is now the single most important counterpart in trade dependencies of OECD as a whole and of 
several OECD countries  individually. There is thus interest in a better u nderstanding of the reasons for the 
emergence of China as a source of dependencies. In particular, the contributions of natural and policy -
related factors, including policies which may have involved market distortions or targeted non -economic 
objectives, n eed to be better understood.  
Trade dependencies of OECD economies on China also need to be put in the context of China’s 
dependencies on OECD. OECD as group  — and several OECD countries  on their own  — are a much  
more important counterpart s in dependencies  of China . Moreover, China’s sectoral dependencies involving 
OECD countries include several industries in which several OECD countries also depend on China, which 
signals the mutual character of some trade dependencies.  
The current debate on ‘de -risking’ international trade  needs to consider carefully  for the possible costs and 
benefits of different policy choices . The different methodologies used to produce evidence unanimously 
demonstrate  a relatively high degree of trade interdependency  between the  OECD  and MNOE countries  
(and especially between OECD countries and China) as well as  potentially high economic costs of 
significant trade fragmentation.  OECD countries in Asia and Pacific come across as bearing the highest 
cost of fragmentation, followed by Europe (where Germany and the Netherlands are affected more than 
on average), while OECD countries in North America record lower impacts. MNOEs , including China,  tend 
to be affected relatively more than the OECD.

  8. Annex es 
8.1. Annex to Chapter  3. Trade data analysis  
8.1.1. Measuring trade concentration as an approach to identifying trade dependency  
The idea behind identifying trade dependencies on the basis of high bilateral trade shares is that it is likely 
to be more difficult to find alternative pa rtners in cases of disruptions of relatively large trade flows 
(i.e. those which account for high shares of exports or imports of a given product). In addition, when 
alternatives cannot be found, these disruptions may be relatively more economically harmfu l than 
disruptions to flows which are small. At the same time, individual bilateral trade flows should be interpreted 
in the overall market context and it is likely that the higher the overall concentration of trade across all 
partners the more difficult i t may be to substitute toward alternative partners.  
While using the combined share and concentration criteria is intuitive, there are no strong theoretical 
indications as to what specific measures and thresholds should be used to appropriately separate tr ade 
dependencies from normal trade flows. This chapter follows several recent studies which make use of the 
Herfindahl -Hirschman Index  to measure concentration (HHI thereafter ).  
HHI is calculated as the sum of squared market shares and lies between 1/ n, when all of the n suppliers 
have equal shares, and one, in a monopoly. For example, a value of 0.2 for the HHI would be obtained48, 
if there were only five suppliers and each of them supplied an equal share of 20%, while a value of 0.1 
would be obtained if there were ten suppliers with equal shares of 10%. There are no objective thresholds 
for values of HHI which clearly delineate low and high concentration, but some indicative thresholds have 
been used in applied work. The US Department of Justice and US Fe deral Reserve, for example , consider 
markets with a HHI between 0.15 and 0.25 to be moderately concentrated and markets with HHI equal to 
or more than 0.25 to be highly concentrated49, although, as is discussed further in this chapter, 
interpretation of th e values of this index is necessarily somewhat arbitrary and should ideally be 
accompanied by a more detailed contextual analysis .  
To paint a comprehensive picture of trade concentration and trade dependency, the chapter analyses the 
values of HHI for dif ferent levels of trade, including global and national concentrations of exports and 
imports. It also demonstrates how the information on global and national concentrations can be combined 
to determine cases of ‘excessive’ national concentration. Finally, t he main part of the analysis assesses 
the global distributions of bilateral trade flows in terms of the trade shares and concentration ratios they 
are associated with. On this basis, the analysis subsequently defines the candidates for bilateral product -
level dependencies as bilateral trade flows accounting for 10% or more of the value of overall national 
imports or exports of a specific product and for which the overall national imports or exports are relatively 
highly concentrated across the trading partn ers (HHI of 0.2 or higher, see Section 3.5). The analysis then 
zooms in on the possible cases of dependencies and identifies partners which account for large portions 
of these dependencies to characterise the geographical structure of bilateral trade depen dencies and its 
evolution in time.  
There are several qualifications associated with this approach which should be mentioned at the outset. 
The ability to diversify suppliers may depend on several factors which may be not well captured by trade 
shares and t rade concentration measures. These factors may be related to the different economic sources 
of concentration as well as natural and technological characteristics of products and markets. For example, 
while comparative advantage and specialisation  are expec ted to  result in concentration, these concepts in 
themselves do not imply difficulty of substitution (i.e. the notion of comparative advantage and 
specialisation is consistent with competitive markets and flexible market entry).  The ability to substitute i s 
also determined by the time frame considered and product -specific technology and innovation outlooks 
(i.e. over the long term the possibility of substitution by technological innovations is greater than in the 
 
 
48 This is an example as in reality many different constellations o f unequal market shares can yield a given HHI value.

  short and medium term). This is why some qua ntitative studies of trade dependencies are sometimes 
accompanied by consultations with engineers and industry experts (European Commission, 2021 [39]). 
The level of aggregation at which the analysis is conducted is also a potential constraint. Most products 
are highly differentiated by a myriad of characteristics which determine uniqueness and substitutability. 
This heterogeneity may not be well captured even by the relatively disaggregated trade data used in this 
chapter. For example, uses of lithium extracted from salt -flat brines through a process of evaporation and 
chemical recovery  (e.g. for batteries) are different from those for lithium extracted fr om lithium -bearing 
ores, such as spodumene, through a process that involves crushing, roasting and acid leaching . To the 
extent that different types of lithium are classified in the same statistical trade classification even small 
amounts of one type of li thium can be difficult to substitute for others. This is the case not only for different 
grades and specifications of other raw materials but also commodities (e.g. different types of cereals used 
for food production and for industrial uses), as well manuf acturing products (e.g. different electronic chips 
used in different electronic products).  
There are also limitations to the fact that this analysis uses gross trade data and therefore does not account 
for where the value added embodied in the imports actu ally originates, or for the extent to which imports 
are actually retained or used for exports or further processing in other countries. In a world of long and 
complex international supply chains, the weakest link can sometimes determine the vulnerability o f the 
whole chain.  The methodology also abstracts from how much is actually produced and consumed in the 
importing countries and whether trade links concern intra or extra -firm trade flows. This approach can 
therefore miss some dependencies while overstati ng others. The o ther approaches  used in subsequent 
chapters of this study —the OECD’s Inter -Country Input -output and Trade in Value Added (TiVA) data  
(Chapter  4) and the CGE analysis ( Chapter  5)—are used  to correct some of these shortcomings and arrive 
at a more comprehensive assessment.  
Defining bilateral trade dependencies  
Recall that, for each product imported (exported) by a country, the HHI measures the concentration of 
imports (exports) across all the partners by summing up the squared values of all bi lateral trade shares. At 
one extreme, when the product is imported  from (exported to) only one country the value of bilateral share 
is the same as the value of HHI. At another extreme, when there is a large number of partners, each of 
them with a small sha re close to zero, the value of HHI is also converging to zero. In between these 
extremes, there may be cases with relatively high bilateral trade shares which are associated with relatively 
low HHI values (i.e. if there are many other partners with relativ ely low shares). Similarly, some insignificant 
bilateral trade shares may contribute little to high readings of HHI driven by high shares of other partners.  
It can be therefore argued that both the bilateral share and HHI as a measure of overall concentra tion 
contain relevant information and should be considered as joint criteria for ‘dependency’ on a specific 
partner. A high bilateral trade share with a given partner may be not problematic in terms of the ability to 
substitute away if there are many other  partners (which would be consistent with a low or moderate HHI). 
A low bilateral share, in turn, even in the presence of overall high concentration, indicates that the specific 
partner does not contribute much to this concentration and that therefore this  particular link is not 
problematic.  
In this context, bilateral dependencies have been defined in this Chapter  as bilateral trade flows at HS6 
level of product classification that meet the following joint conditions :  
1. The gross imports (exports)  of the giv en product (at the HS6 level) are overall highly concentrated  
(concentration criterion , country -level imports (exports) HHI>=0.2 ).  
2. The import from (export to) a specific partner accounts for a relatively high share of the country  
overall imports (exports) of the product  (bilateral share criterion , bilateral share>=0.1 ).  
The choice of specific thresholds that were used to operationalise the above criteria (bolded out above) 
remains somewhat arbitrary, but it had been supported by an analysis of the global distribution of trade 
along the different values of HHI and bilateral trade shares.  Bilateral imports which jointly meet the two 
criteria  account for 1% of all active bilateral links and for 46% of the value of world trade. It can  be therefore 
concluded that  they constitute  a relatively conservative filter for identifying potential dependencies. These 
conservatively identified candidates for dependencies can be explored  further in more details, including by 
looking at the implicate d products, trading partners and firms.

  8.1.2. Definition of ‘strategic’ products following the Atlantic Council  and the International 
Monetary Fund approach  
A list of strategic products adopted in this chapter follows the study of fragmentation of FDI by (IMF, 
2023 [18]) which had built on a list of sectors designated as strategic in study by the Atlantic Council  (Tran, 
2022 [40]) and mapped th ese sectors to 3 -digit of the International Standard Industrial Classification of all 
economic activities  (ISICs ), resulting in a list of 17 different sectors.  The same study by (IMF, 2023 [18]) also 
used data from quarterly earning calls from NL Analytics (paid data source based on Hassan et al., 2019) 
to identify 3 -digit ISIC industry groups in manufacturing and mining mentioned the most in these earning 
calls (top 3 deciles) along with -reshoring related terms (2017 -2022 ), adding four additional sectors.  A list 
of HS6 codes (as w ell as GTAP classification sectors) associated with these ISIC industries was created 
for the purposes of this study. The HS6 code version of the list was used for separating out and the 
calculations associated with the ‘strategic’ products.  
List of 4 -digit ISIC rev. 4 ‘strategic’ industries included in analysis  
 
8.1.3. Discussion of  criteria used for measuring bilateral trade dependencies  
The choice of specific thresholds that can be used to operationalise the above criteria has been necessarily 
somewhat arb itrary. In particular, while exposures to specific trade partners —as captured bilateral trade 
shares —have straightforward interpretation, it is not clear above what specific threshold the shares can be 
usefully deemed overly high. Similarly, there are no strong international trade theory or empirical research -
based indications as to what threshold can be used for the HHI to detect overly concentrated trade.50  
Some appreciation of the significance of values of different concentration thresholds can be gain ed from 
the analysis of distribution of global trade along the values of theses concentration measure. For example, 
Annex Figure 8.1, Panel A shows that that bilateral imports of products for which imports are relatively 
highly concentrated (import HHI of equal or higher than 0.20) account for more than 51% of the number of 
all globally active HS6 product -level bilateral trade links, and they account for more than 45% of the value 
of global imports. This means that, in line with the US Department of Justice  and US Federal Reserve 
quantitative interpretation of the significance of HHI, around half of world imports can be seen as highly 
concentrated.  
Annex Figure 8.1 Panel B on the other hand shows that most of active bilateral trade links account for 
relativ ely low shares in  countries’ imports. For example, only around 12% of active bilateral trade links at 
the HS6 product level are associated with a bilateral import share of 10% or higher. At the same time, 
these relatively rare trade links are relatively ec onomically important as they account for 69% of the value 
of global trade. The relatively high value share of the relatively few bilateral trade relations at the product 
level is consistent with the relatively high level of concentration of imports at the country level.  
 
 
50 There is the commonly referred to U S Department of Justice/  US Federal Reserve  interpretation (Section 3.2), but 
it is not clear how exactly it has been established.

Both across the OECD and MNOEs , the average incidence of export dependencies declined between 
1997 -99 and 2017 -19, and this process was more rapid for the MNOE  grouping (Figure 8.2). However, 
both groupings experienced an increase in export dependencies in the COVID -19 pandemic period (2020 -

Average number of bilateral export dependencies per country in each of the country grouping  
 
Source: OECD calculations using the BACI data.  
However, there were also large differences across different OECD and  MNOE  countries and not in all 
individual countries did the count of export dependencies decline in the main period. Among the G7 
countries, Canada  — the OECD country with the highest coun t of dependencies in the grouping  ― had 
more than four times more dependencies than Germany  —t he country with the lowest count  — although 
the count of Canada’s dependencies has been gradually falling in the analysed period (Figure 8.3). The 
United States and the United Kingdom however saw their export dependencies count increase. We also 
see that, apart from Canada, dependencies increased for all other G7 countries in the COVID -19 period.  
Among the other OECD countries covered in this exercise, most have s een export dependency counts 
decline in the main period. Poland experienced the most dramatic decline which is interesting in the context 
of its strong economic growth and export performance in this period. The Netherlands and Spain had been 
and still are the least dependent in this OECD sub -group. All the countries in this OECD sub -grouping 
grouping saw increases in dependencies in the COVID -19 period (Figure 8.4).  
Among the MNOEs , Russia has had the most bilateral export dependencies since the beginning of the 
period and their level exceeded the dependency levels of the most dependent OECD countries. All the 
other MNOES  reduced their  export dependencies in the main periods, and th ese reductions were the most 
impressive for Brazil and China. In India, the declining trend has been reversed in the most recent period.

  8.2. Annex to Chapter  4 The ICIO-TIVA  Methodology  
8.2.1. Scenario decomposition or running standalone hypothetical extraction scenarios?  
The principal scenario is a set of the following five ‘sub -scenarios’ : 1. OECD -CHN, 2. EU27 -MNOE;  
3. EU27 -CHN ; 4. USMCA51-MNOE; and 5. USMCA -CHN. Since  the five scenarios are all nested within the 
principal OECD -MNOE scenario52, we can construct 𝚫𝐱 for scenarios 2 -6 by decomposing the value of 𝚫𝐱 
obtained for scenario 1 as discussed above. The advantage of doing so is practical: since the 
decomposition is  additive, the results from different scenarios can now be stacked on top of each other in 
a single chart which saves space and makes for easier visual comparisons.  
Do the results from this scenario -decomposition approach differ from those we get from runn ing a series 
of stand -alone scenarios? The short answer is no. The figure below plots the two sets of results against 
each other for the various scenarios. The differences are hardly detectable for 4 out 6 scenarios.  
The only panels in which we do observe  some differences are those involving the European aggregate. 
The differences here, however, are due not to the technique giving different results, but rather on the fact 
that we are comparing different shocks. The OECD Europe shocks include the UK but omi t Romania, 
Bulgaria, Cyprus ,53 and Malta. The reverse is true of the EU27 shocks.  
In practice, however, the points that depart from the equality line are those that relate to the UK, Romania, 
Bulgaria , Cyprus and Malta themselves (figure below). For all other countries, the differences are generally 
very small. Most notably, the results for the EU27 aggregates are virtually identical.  
 
 
51 USMCA refers to the signatory countries of the United States -Mexico -Canada Agreement.  
52 This is true only approximately because Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta are part of the EU but not of the 
OECD. In the context of our analysis, however, these are small economies and do not affect our results in any 
meaningful way.  
53 Note by Türkiye: The info rmation in this document with reference to “Cyprus” relates to the southern part of the 
Island. There is no single authority representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Türkiye 
recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) . Until a lasting and equitable solution is found within the 
context of the United Nations, Türkiye shall preserve its position concerning the “Cyprus issue”.  
Note by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the European Union: The Republic of  Cyprus is 
recognised by all members of the United Nations with the exception of Türkiye. The information in this document 
relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus .

  8.2.2. Europe  
The chart below  provides additional  breakdown for the EU -level results in Figure 4.6. The chart displays 
the co ntribution of each individual MNOE to the value added changes in EU27 sectors resulting from the 
OECD -MNOE shock .  
 
8.3. Annex to Chapter  5 CGE modelling  
8.3.1. The OECD METRO Model  
The METRO model (OECD, 2023 [41])is a multi -country, multi -sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) 
model that traces international interdependencies in a theoretically and empirically consistent framework, 
and incorporates several features of GVC participation such as trade of interme diate and final products 
and trade in value added (TiVA) concepts.  
The model builds on the GLOBE model developed by McDonald and Thierfelder (2013[42]) . The novelty 
and strength of METRO lies in the detailed trade structure and the differentiation of commodities by end 
use. Specifically, commodities and thus trade flows are distinguished by whether they are destined for 
intermediate use, for use by households, for government consumption, or as investment commodities.  
The unde rlying framework of METRO consists of a series of individually specified economies interlinked 
through trade relationships. As is common in  CGE models, the price system is linearly homogeneous, with 
a focus on relative, not absolute, price changes. Each re gion has its own numeraire, typically the consumer  
price index, and a nominal exchange rate (an exchange rate index of reference regions serves as model 
numeraire). Prices between regions change relative to the reference region.  
The database of the model relies on the GTAP v1 1 database pre-release version 2 (Aguiar et  al., 2022 [43]) 
in combination with the OECD Inter -Country Input -Output Tables, which are the main source of the OECD 
Trade in Value Adde d Indicators and allows the model to distinguish trade for use in intermediate 
production or final demand. Policy information combines tariff and tax information from GTAP with OECD 
estimates of non -tariff measures on goods (Cadot et al, (2018 [44]); Gourdon et al,  (2020 [45])), services (Benz 
and Gonzales, (2019 [46]); Benz and Jaax, (2020 [47]); Benz and Jaax, (2022 [48])), trade facilitation (OECD, 
2018 [49]) and export restricting measures. The METRO database contains 151 countries and regional 
aggregates and 65 sectors . For this analysis the database as aggregated to 23 regions and 23 sectors . 
See Annex Table 8.1 for the description of the regions and sectors.  

118    
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  The model is firmly rooted in microeconom ic theory, with firms maximising profits and creating output from 
primary inputs (i.e. land, natural resources, labour and capital), which are combined using  constant 
elasticity of substitution (CES) technology, and intermediate inputs in fixed shares (Leo ntief technology). 
Households are assumed to maximise utility subject to a Stone -Geary utility function, which allows  for the 
inclusion of a subsistence level of consumption. Substitution elasticities are sourced from GTAP, while the 
income elasticity used  in the Stone -Geary utility function is based on USDA estimates  (Muhammad et  al., 
2011 [50]) and (Seale, Regmi and Bernstein, 2003 [51])). All commodity and activity taxes are expressed as 
ad valorem tax rates, and taxes are the only income source to the government.  
In the configuration of the model used for the simulations , capital and labour stocks are assumed fixed, 
and factors are mobile between industries, but not between economies. All fa ctors, including capital and 
labour, are fully employed and returns to land and capital and wage rates are flexible. Tax rates are fixed. 
Government expenditure is fixed in volume terms at base levels while the government balance is allowed 
to adjust. The trade balance is assumed flexible. Investment as share of total final demand is remains 
fixed , but the household savings rate can adjust .

8.4.1 Scenarios to assess trade dependencies  
To assess trade dependences using the METRO model, a set of styli sed scenarios reducing trade between 
OECD countries  and MNOE countries were performed which reduced bilateral trade in all industries 
betwe en the two groups.  The scenarios were implemented using import tariffs and export taxes applied in 
OECD countries  calibrated to reduce trade by 10%. Because of the assumption that government  
   119 
OECD TRADE POLICY PAPER N°280 © OECD 2024  
  expenditure is fixed to base levels in volume terms, it assumed t hat the extra government revenue from 
the tax increase is not spent but set aside in the form of government savings.  
Moreover, to help decompose and isolate the effects reduced trade between specific regions, countries, 
and sectors , reductions in trade of between different groups and different sectors are simulated separately. 
The approximately  linear nature of the model allows to add and subtract the results of different simulations 
to decompose and isolate effects.  
The main scenari o 
• Imports and exports of goods and services between the OECD countries  and MNOE are reduced 
10% 
Additional scenarios for decomposition  
To decompose effect by certain countries or regions  
• Imports and exports of goods and services between OECD countries and China are reduced 10%  
• Imports and exports of goods and services between EU27 Members and MNOE are reduced 10%  
• Imports and exports of goods and services between EU27 Members and China are reduced 10%  
To decompose effect of reduction of exports vs reduction of imports  
• Imports of goods and services between OECD countries and China are reduced 10%  
• Exports of goods and services between OECD countries and China are reduced 10%  
• Imports of goods a nd services between EU27 Members and China are reduced 10%  
• Exports of goods and services between EU27 Members and China are reduced 10%  
To decompose effect of certain sectors  
• Imports and exports of electronic equipment  between OECD countries and China are reduced 
10% 
• Imports and exports of motor vehicles  and parts between OECD  countries  and China are reduced 
10% 
• Imports and exports of mineral products between OECD countries and China are reduced 10%  
• Imports and exports of chemicals  between OECD countrie s and China are reduced 10%  
• Imports and exports of other manufacturing between OECD countries and China are reduced 10%  
The selection of individual products selected for decomposition are based the list of ISIC Rev 4 3-digit 
codes identified by IMF (2023 [18]) as stra tegic which were subsequently mapped HS6 digit codes and then 
to GTAP sectors. Non-energy GTAP sectors where at least a quarter of the associated HS6 codes are 
considered strategic in the first mapping were selected for the decomposition simulations.  Other  
manufacturing was also included despite not meeting this threshold.
