459Tracing Value-Added and Double Counting  
in Gross Exports†
By Robert Koopman, Zhi Wang, and Shang-Jin Wei*
This paper proposes an accounting framework that breaks up a coun-
try’s gross exports into various value-added components by source and additional double-counted terms. Our parsimonious framework bridges a gap between official trade statistics ( in gross value terms) 
and national accounts ( in value-added terms) , and integrates all pre-
vious measures of vertical specialization and value-added trade in the literature into a unified framework. To illustrate the potential of such a method,  we present a number of applications including re-comput-
ing revealed comparative advantages and the magnifying impact of multi-stage production on trade costs. ( JEL E01, E16, F14, F23, L14)
As different stages of production are now regularly performed in different coun-
tries, intermediate inputs cross borders multiple times. As a result, traditional trade 
statistics become increasingly less reliable as a gauge of the value contributed by 
any particular country. This paper integrates and generalizes the many attempts 
in the literature at tracing value added by country and measuring vertical special-ization in international trade. We provide a unified conceptual framework that is more comprehensive than the current literature. By design, this is an accounting exercise, and does not directly examine the causes and the consequences of global production chains. However, an accurate and well-defined conceptual framework 
to account for value added by sources is a necessary step toward a better under -
standing of all these issues.
Supply chains can be described as a system of value-added sources and destina-
tions. Within a supply chain, each producer purchases inputs and then adds value, 
which is included in the cost of the next stage of production. At each stage, the 
value added equals the value paid to the factors of production in the exporting 
country. However, as all official trade statistics are measured in gross terms, which

include both intermediate inputs and final products, they “double count” the value 
of  intermediate goods that cross international borders more than once. Such a con-
ceptual and empirical shortcoming of gross trade statistics, as well as their inconsis-
tency with the System of National Accounts (SNA ) accounting standards, has long 
been recognized by both the economics profession and policy makers.1
Case studies on global value chains based on detailed micro data for a single prod-
uct or a single sector in industries such as electronics, apparel, and motor vehicles 
have provided detailed examples of the discrepancy between gross and value-added 
trade. While enhancing our intuitive understanding of global production chains in 
particular industries, they do not offer a comprehensive picture of the gap between value-added and gross trade, and an economy’s participation in cross-border pro-duction chains. Several researchers have examined the issue of vertical specializa-tion on a systematic basis, including the pioneering effort of Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001)—henceforth, HIY . They suggested that a country can participate in ver -
tical specialization in two ways: (i) uses imported intermediate inputs to produce 
exports; (ii) exports intermediate goods that are used as inputs by other countries to 
produce goods for export. HIY proposed to measure the imported foreign content in a country’s exports based on a country’s Input-Output (IO) table.
There are two key assumptions in HIY’s foreign content (VS) estimation: the 
intensity in the use of imported inputs is the same between production for exports and production for domestic sales; and imports are 100 percent foreign sourced. The first assumption is violated in the presence of processing exports, which is a significant portion of exports for a large number of developing countries (Koopman, Wang, and Wei 2008 and 2012). The second assumption does not hold when there is more than one country exporting intermediate goods.
A growing recent literature aims to estimate value-added trade using global Inter-
Country  Input-Output (ICIO) tables based on the Global Trade Analysis Project 
(GTAP, Narayanan and Walmsley 2008) and World Input-Output database (WIOD, Timmer 2012), such as Daudin, Rifflart, and Schweisguth (2011), Johnson and Noguera (2012), and Stehrer, Foster, and de Vries (2012). Most of these papers 
discuss the connections between their works with HIY , but are more closely related to the factor content trade literature, except Koopman et al. (2010). By integrating the literature on vertical specialization and the literature on trade in value added, this paper makes the following contributions:
First, we provide a unified and transparent mathematical framework to completely 
decompose gross exports into its various components, including exports of value 
added, domestic value added that returns home, foreign value added, and other addi-
tional double-counted terms. Measures of vertical specialization and trade in value added in the existing literature can be derived from this framework and expressed as some linear combinations of these components. We show why some existing mea-sures are special cases of the generalized measures in our framework and why some 
have to be modified from their original definitions in a more general multi-country 
framework with unrestricted intermediate trade.

Second, rather than simply excluding double-counted items from official trade 
statistics, we provide an accounting formula that quantifies different types of 
double-counted items for the first time in the literature. Knowing the relative 
importance of different double-counted items in a country’s gross exports can 
help us to gauge the depth and pattern of that country’s participation in global production chains. For example, in some sectors, China and the United States may have a similar amount of value-added exports. However, the composition of the double-counted terms can be very different. For China, the double-counted terms may show up primarily in the form of the use of foreign components ( e.g., 
foreign product designs or machinery)  in the final goods that China exports. For 
the United States, the double-counted terms may show up primarily in the form of domestic value added finally returned and consumed at home ( e.g., product 
designs by Apple that are used in the final Apple products produced abroad but sold in the US market) . The structure of these double-counted items in addition to 
their total sums offer additional information about the United States and China’s respective positions in the global value chain.
Third, our accounting framework establishes a precise relationship between 
 value-added measures of trade and official trade statistics, thus providing an observ-
able benchmark for value-added trade estimates, as well as a workable way for national and international statistical agencies to remedy the missing information in 
current official trade statistics without dramatically changing the existing data col-
lection practices of national customs authorities.
Fourth, our estimated global ICIO table may better capture the international 
source and use of intermediate goods than in previous databases in two ways. In estimating intermediate goods in bilateral trade, we use end-use classifications 
(intermediate or final)  of detailed import statistics rather than the conventional 
proportionality assumptions. In addition, we estimate separate input-output coef-
ficients for processing trade in China and Mexico, the two major users of such regimes in the world.
Finally, we report a number of applications to illustrate the potential of our 
approach to reshape our understanding of global trade. For example, with gross 
trade data, the business services sector is a revealed comparative advantage sector 
for India. In contrast, if one uses our estimated domestic value added in exports instead, the same sector becomes a revealed comparative disadvantage sector for India in 2004. The principal reason for this is how the indirect exports of busi-ness services are counted in high-income countries. Consider Germany. Most of its 
manufacturing exports embed German domestic business services. In comparison, 
most of Indian goods exports use comparatively little Indian business services. Once indirect exports of domestic business services are taken into account, Indian’s busi-ness service exports become much less impressive relative to Germany and many other developed countries. As another example, the value-added decomposition shows that a significant portion of China’s trade surplus to the United States in gross 
trade terms reflects indirect value-added exports that China does on behalf of Japan, 
Korea and Taiwan. While such stories have been understood in qualitative terms, our framework offers a way to quantify these effects.
This paper is organized as follows. Section I presents the conceptual framework 
of gross exports accounting. Section II discusses database construction methods, 
462

especially on how to estimate the required inter-country IO model from currently 
available data sources. Section III presents a number of illustrative applications. Section IV concludes.
I. Gross Exports Accounting: Concepts and Measurement
A. Concepts
Four measures have been proposed in the existing literature:
 (i) The first measure of vertical specialization, proposed by HIY (2001), refers to the imported content in a country’s exports. This measure, labeled as VS, includes both the directly and indirectly imported input content in exports. In mathematical terms, it can be expressed as
(1)  VS =  A 
M (I −  A D  ) −1 E.
 (ii) A second measure, also proposed by HIY (2001) and labeled as VS1, looks at 
vertical specialization from the export side, and measures the value of inter -
mediate exports sent indirectly through third countries to final destinations. 
However, HIY did not provide a mathematical definition for VS1.
 (iii) A third measure is the value of a country’s exported goods that are used 
as imported inputs by the rest of the world to produce final goods that are shipped back to home. This measure was proposed by Daudin, Rifflart, and 
Schweisguth (2011). Because it is a subset of VS1, they call it VS1
*.
 (iv) A fourth measure is value-added exports, which is value added produced in source country s and absorbed in destination country r. Johnson and 
Noguera (2012) defined this measure and proposed to use the ratio of value-
added exports to gross exports, or the “V AX ratio” as a summary measure of 
 value-added content of trade.
By definition, as value added is a “net” concept, double counting is not allowed. 
As the first three measures of vertical specialization all involve values that show up 
in more than one country’s gross exports, they, by necessity, have to include some double-counted portions of the official trade statistics. This implies that these two types of measures are not equal to each other in general because double counting is only allowed in one of them. They become equal only in some special cases as we 
will show later both analytically and numerically. In addition, these existing mea-
sures are all proposed as stand-alone indicators. No common mathematical frame-work proposed in the literature provides a unified accounting for them and spells out their relationships explicitly.
We provide below a unified framework that breaks up a country’s gross exports 
into the sum of various components. The value-added exports, VS, VS1, and VS1
* 
are linear combinations of these components. In addition, we show how one may 
463
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
generalize the VS measure without the restrictive assumption made by HIY (no 
 two-way trade in intermediate goods). By properly including various double-counted 
terms, our accounting is complete in the sense that the sum of these well-identified 
components yields 100 percent of the gross exports.
For ease of understanding, we start with a discussion of a two-country one sector 
case in Section II. We relate the components of our decomposition formula with 
the existing measures in the literature in Section III. We provide several numeri-cal examples in Section IV to show intuitively how our gross exports account-ing equation  works. Finally, we present the most general G -country  N-sector  
case.
B. Two-Country Case
Assume a two-country (home and foreign) world, in which each country  pro-
duces in a single tradable sector. The good in that sector can be consumed directly or used as an intermediate input, and each country exports both intermediate and final goods to the other.
All gross output produced by Country s must be used as either an intermediate 
good or a final good, either at home or abroad. So Country s’ gross output,  x 
s , has to 
satisfy the following accounting relationship:
(2)  x s  =  a ss   x s  +  a sr   x r  +  y ss  +  y sr ,  r,s  = 1, 2,
where  y sr  is the final demand in Country r for the final good produced in Country s, 
and  a sr  is the input-output (IO) coefficient, describing units of intermediate goods 
produced in s  used in the production of one unit gross output in Country r . The two-
country production and trade system can be written as an inter-country input-output 
(ICIO)  model as follows:
(3)  x 1 
 =  a 11  a 12  x 1 
+ y 11  +  y 12  .
 x 2  a 21  a 22  x 2  y 21  +  y 22 
With rearranging, we have
(4)  x 1  = I −  a 11 − a 12 −1
 y 11  +  y 12  =  b 11  b 12  y 1  .
  x 2 − a 21 I −  a 22  y 21  +  y 22  b 21  b 22  y 2 
Since equation  (4) takes into account both the direct and indirect use of a coun-
try’s gross output as intermediate goods in the production of its own and foreign 
final goods, the coefficients in the B matrix ( Leontief inverse)  are referred to as 
“total requirement coefficients” in the input-output literature. Specifically,  b 11  
is the total amount of Country 1’s gross output needed to produce an extra unit 
of the final good in Country 1 ( which is for consumption in both Countries 1  
464
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
and 2) ;  b 12  is the total amount of Country 1’s gross output needed to produce an 
extra unit of the final good in Country 2 ( again for consumption both at home 
and abroad) . Similar interpretations can be assigned to the other two coefficients 
in the B matrix.
We can break up each country’s gross output according to where it is ultimately 
absorbed by rearranging both countries’ final demand into a matrix format by source 
and destination, and rewrite equation (4) as follows:
(5) x 11  x 12 
= b 11  b 12  y 11  y 12 
= b 11  y 11  +  b 12   y 21  b 11  y 12  +  b 12   y 22 ,
 x 21  x 22  b 21  b 22  y 21  y 22  b 21  y 11  +  b 22   y 21  b 21  y 12  +  b 22   y 22 
where ysr is as defined in equation (2), giving the final goods produced in Country s 
and consumed in Country r. This final demand matrix in the middle of equation (5) 
is a 2 × 2 matrix, summing along each row of the matrix equals ys , which repre-
sents the global use of the final goods produced in each country as specified in 
equation (4).
We label the 2 × 2 matrix on the left-hand side of equation  (5) the “gross out-
put decomposition matrix.” It fully decomposes each country’s gross outputs according to where it is absorbed. Each element  x 
sr  is the gross output in source 
Country s necessary to sustain final demand in destination Country r. Summing 
along its row equals total gross output in Country s,  x s  as specified in equation (2). 
For example, it breaks up Country 1’s gross output  x 1  into two parts:  x 1  =  x 11  +  x 12 .  
While  x 11  is the part of Country 1’s gross output that is ultimately absorbed in Country 1,  
x 12  is the part of Country 1’s gross output that is ultimately absorbed in Country 2.
The RHS of equation  (5) further decomposes  x 11  itself into two parts:  
 x 11  =  b 11  y 11  +  b 12   y 21 . The first part,  b 11  y 11  is the part of Country 1’s gross output 
required to produce Country  1’s final good that is consumed in Country  1. The 
second part,  b 12   y 21 , is the part of Country 1’s gross output that is exported as an 
intermediate good, and eventually returns home as part of Country 1’s imports from 
abroad (embedded in foreign final goods).
Similarly,  x 12  can also be decomposed into two parts:  x 12  =  b 11   y 12  +  b 12   y 22 . The 
first part,  b 11  y 12  is the part of Country 1’s gross output that is used to produce exported 
final good that is consumed abroad.  b 12   y 22  is the part of Country 1’s gross output 
that is exported as an intermediate good and used in Country 2 to produce final good 
that is consumed there. Of course,  x 1  =  x 11  +  x 12  is nothing but Country 1’s total 
output. By assumption, they are produced by the same technology and therefore 
have the same share of domestic value added.
By the same interpretation, Country 2’s gross output also can be first broken 
up into two parts:  x 2  =  x 21  +  x 22 .  x 21  is Country 2’s gross output that is ultimately 
absorbed in Country  1, which can be in turn broken up to  b 21  y 11  +  b 22   y 21 .  x 22  is 
Country 2’s domestic absorption of its own gross output, and can be further broken 
up to  b 21  y 12  +  b 22   y 22 .
By definition, to produce one unit of Country  1’s good, a11 units of domestic 
intermediate good is used, and a21 units of imported intermediate good is used. 
Therefore, the fraction of domestic output that represents the domestic value added 
in Country 1 is  v 1  = 1 −  a 11  −  a 21 . Similarly, the share of domestic value added in 
465
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
Country 2’s gross output is:  v 2  = 1 −  a 12  −  a 22 . Therefore, we can define a 2 × 2 
direct value-added coefficient matrix as
(6) V =  [   
  v 1    
0 
    
  0   
 v 2     ] .
Multiplying V with the Leontief inverse B produces the 2 × 2 value-added share 
(VB) matrix, our basic measure of value-added shares by source of production:
(7) VB =  [   
  v 1   b 11    
 v 2   b 21     
  v 1   b 12    
 v 2   b 22     ] .
Within VB,  v 1  b 11  and  v 2   b 22  denote the domestic value-added share of domestically 
produced products for Country 1 and Country 2 respectively;  v 2   b 21  and  v 1  b 12  denote 
the share of foreign country’s value added in the same goods. Because all value 
added must be either domestic or foreign, the sum along each column is unity2:
(8)  v 1   b 11  +  v 2   b 21  =  v 1   b 12  +  v 2   b 22  = 1.
Given the assumption on the input-output coefficients, there is no difference in 
the share of domestic value added in Country 1’s production for goods absorbed at 
home versus its production for exports.3 Therefore, the total domestic value added in 
Country 1’s gross output is simply  v 1   x 1 ; it is Country 1’s GDP by definition.
The total value added in Country 1’s gross outputs can be easily broken up into 
two parts based on where it is ultimately absorbed:  v 1   x 1  =  v 1   x 11  +  v 1   x 12 where  
 v 1   x 11  is the domestic value added that is ultimately absorbed at home, and  v 1   x 12  is 
the domestic value added that is ultimately absorbed abroad.
The last part,  v 1   x 12 , is also Country 1’s exports of value added. It is instructive 
to decompose the last item further. Since  v 1   x 12  =  v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22 , Country 1’s 
exports of value added has two components: Country 1’s value added embedded 
in Country 1’s exports of final good that is absorbed in Country 2 ( v 1   b 11   y 12 ); and 
Country 1’s value added in its exports of intermediate good that is used by Country 2 
to produce final good that is ultimately locally consumed ( v 1   b 12   y 22 ).
Note that  v 1   x 12  is conceptually the same as Country 1’s value-added exports as 
defined by Johnson and Noguera (2012) except that we express it as the sum of two 
components related only to the final demand in the two countries. To summarize, 
Country 1’s and 2’s “value-added exports” are, respectively,
(9)  V T 12  ≡  v 1   x 12  =  v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22 
  V T 21  ≡  v 2   x 21  =  v 2   b 21   y 11  +  v 2   b 22   y 21  .
2 Note that the VB matrix is not any arbitrary share matrix, but rather the one that reflects the underlying pro-
duction structure embedded in the ICIO model specified in equation (3). It contains all the needed information on 
value-added production by source.
3 Such an assumption is maintained by HIY (2001), Johnson and Noguera (2012), and Daudin, Rifflart, and 
Schweisguth (2011). One might allow part of the production for exports (processing exports) to take on different 
input-output coefficients. Such a generalization is pursued by Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2012), who have worked out a generalized formula for computing the share of domestic value added in a country’s gross exports when pro-cessing trade is prevalent.
466
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
Intuitively, there are at least two reasons for a country’s exports of value added 
to be smaller than its gross exports to the rest of the world. First, the production for 
its exports may contain foreign value added or imported intermediate goods (a). 
Second, part of the domestic value added that is exported may return home after 
being embodied in the imported foreign goods rather than being absorbed abroad (b). 
In other words, exports of value added are a net concept; it has to exclude from the gross exports both foreign value added and the part of domestic value added that is imported back to home.
Identifying and estimating these double-counted terms in gross exports have 
important implications for measuring each country’s position in global value-chains. For example, two countries can have identical ratios of value-added exports to gross exports but very different ratios of (a) and (b). Those countries that are mainly 
upstream in global production chains, such as product design, tend to have a large value of (b) but a small value of (a). In comparison, those countries mainly special-
izing in assembling imported components to produce final products tend to have 
a small value of (b) but a big value of (a). However, the existing literature lacks a uniform and transparent framework to compute exports of value added, part (a) and 
part (b) simultaneously. We venture to do this next. Without loss of generality, let us 
work with Country 1’s gross exports first:
(10)  e 
12  =  y 12  +  a 12   x 2  .
It says that Country  1’s exports consist of final goods and intermediate goods. 
Combining (10) with equation (8), we have
(11)   e 12  = ( v 1   b 11  +  v 2   b 21 )( y 12  +  a 12   x 2 )
  =  v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 2   b 21   y 12  +  v 1   b 11   a 12   x 2  +  v 2   b 21   a 12   x 2 
  =  v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 2   b 21   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22  +  v 1   b 12   y 21  
  +  v 1   b 12   a 21   x 1  +  v 2   b 21   a 12   x 2  .
A step-by-step proof of  v 1   b 11   a 12   x 2  =  v 1   b 12   y 22  +  v 1   b 12   y 21  +  v 1   b 12   a 21   x 1  can be 
found in online Appendix A.
Here we give the economic intuition behind it. The total value of Country 1’s 
intermediate exports must include two types of value. First, it must include all 
value added by Country 1 in its imports from Country 2. To see this, we note that in order for exported value produced by Country 1 to come back through its imports, it must have first been embodied in Country 1’s intermediate exports, which is  v 
1   b 12   y 21  +  v 1   b 12   a 21   x 1 . Second, it must include all value added generated 
in Country 1 that is absorbed in Country 2 after being used as intermediate inputs 
by Country 2, which is  v 1   b 12   y 22 .
Note that multiplying the Leontief inverse with intermediate goods exports leads 
to some double counting of gross output and thus some value terms in exports. 
467
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
However, in order to account for 100 percent of the value of Country 1’s inter -
mediate goods exports and to identify what is double counted, we have to include 
them into the accounting equation first. By decomposing the last two terms in equa-
tion (11) further, we can see precisely what is double counted. Using the gross 
output identity (equation (2))  x 1  =  y 11  +  a 11   x 1  +  e 12  and  x 2  =  y 22  +  a 22   x 2  +  e 21 ,  it is easy to show that
(12)   x 1  = (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11  + (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12 
   x 2  = (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22  + (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21  .
(I −  a 11  ) −1  y 11  is the gross output needed to sustain final goods that are both pro-
duced and consumed in Country 1, using domestically produced intermediate 
goods; deducting it from Country 1’s total gross output, what is left is the gross 
output needed to sustain Country 1’s production of its gross exports  e 12 . Therefore 
the two terms in the right-hand side of equation (12) both have straightforward 
economic meanings. We can further show that  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11  =  b 11   y 11  −  
(1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11  (see proof, also in online Appendix A), which is the total gross out-
put needed to sustain final goods both produced and consumed in Country 1, but 
using intermediate goods that originated in Country 1 and shipped to Country 2 
for processing before being re-imported by Country 1 (gross output sold indi-rectly in the domestic market). These two parts plus  b 
12   y 21 sum to  x 11  in equa-
tion (5), which is the gross output of Country 1 absorbed in Country 1 to sustain 
its domestic final demand both directly and indirectly. It indicates that Country 1’s 
domestic final demand is satisfied by three production channels: (i) (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11   
is part of Country 1’s gross output sold directly in the domestic market that is 
consumed there; (ii)  b 12   y 21  is part of Country 1’s gross output used as intermedi-
ate goods by Country 2 to produce final goods that are consumed in Country 1;  
(iii)  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11  is part of Country 1’s gross output used as intermediate 
goods by Country 2 to produce intermediate goods that are exported to country 1 
to produce final goods in Country 1 that are consumed there. They are all needed to 
sustain the domestic final demand in Country 1, but they differ in terms of how they 
participate in international trade.
Replacing  x 1  by (1 −  a 11  ) −1  y 11  + (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12  and  x 2  by (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22  + 
(1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21  in equation  (11), and rearranging terms, we can fully decompose 
Country 1’s gross exports into its various value-added and double-counted compo-
nents as follows:
(13)  e 12  =  v 1   b 11   e 12  +  v 2   b 21   e 12  = [ v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22 ]
 + [ v 1   b 12   y 21  +  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ] +  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12 
 + [ v 2   b 21   y 12  +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ] +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21  .
While the algebra to arrive at equation (13) may be a bit tedious, expressing a 
country’s gross exports as the sum of these eight terms on the right-hand side of equa-
tion (13) is very useful. We go over their economic interpretations systematically.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
The first two terms in equation  (13) (or the two terms in the first square bracket) 
are value-added exports, i.e., Country 1’s domestic value added absorbed outside 
Country 1.
The third term,  v 1   b 12   y 21  is Country 1’s domestic value added that is initially embod-
ied in its intermediate exports but is returned home as part of Country 1’s imports of 
the final good. The fourth term,  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 , is also Country 1’s domestic 
value added that is initially exported by Country 1 as part of its intermediate goods 
to Country 2, but then is returned home via its intermediate imports from Country 2 
to produce final goods that are absorbed at home. Both the third and the fourth terms 
are domestic value added produced in Country 1, exported to Country 2, but then return to and stay in Country 1. Both are counted at least twice in trade statistics as they first leave Country 1 for Country 2, and then leave Country 2 for Country 1 ( and 
ultimately stay in Country 1) . Note that the value represented by these two terms can 
be embodied in trade transactions that cross borders back and forth more than twice as 
long as they originate in Country 1 and are ultimately consumed in Country 1.
The fifth term,  v 
1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12 , may be called a “pure double-counted 
term.” The reason for labeling it as such will become clear after we present a similar 
dissection of Country 2’s gross exports and a further decomposition of this term. 
This term only occurs when both countries export intermediate goods. If at least one 
country does not export intermediate goods (i.e., no two-way trade in intermediate goods), this terms disappears.
The sixth term, v 
2   b 21   y 12 , is the foreign value added in Country 1’s gross exports of 
final goods; and the seventh term,  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 , is the foreign value added 
in Country 1’s gross exports of intermediate goods. They both ultimately go back to 
the foreign country and are consumed there.
The eighth (and the last) term is another pure double-counted item in Country 1’s 
gross exports. Similar to the fifth term, this term would disappear if at least one country does not export intermediate goods.
In a similar way, we can express Country 2’s gross exports as a sum of eight terms:
(14)  e 
21  =  v 1   b 12   e 21  +  v 2   b 22   e 21  = [ v 2   b 22   y 21  +  v 2   b 21   y 11 ]
 + [ v 2   b 21   y 12  +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ] +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21 
 + [ v 1   b 12   y 21  +  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ] +  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12  .
Comparing equations ( 13) and ( 14), there are a few noteworthy features. First, the 
third, fourth, and fifth terms in Country 1’s gross exports ( 13) are identical to the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth terms in Country 2’s exports ( 14), and vice versa. This means 
that the value added, that is initially produced and exported by Country 1 but then re-
imported by Country 1, is exactly the same as foreign value added in Country 2’s gross exports to Country 1. Symmetrically, the foreign value added in Country 1’s gross exports to Country 2, is the same as Country 2’s value added, initially produced and 
exported by Country 2, but reappears as part of Country 1’s gross exports to Country 2.
Second, while the first and second terms in equations (13) and 
(14) constitute 
value-added exports, all other terms are double-counted components in a  country’s 
official exports statistics. However, there are conceptually interesting differences 
469
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
among the third and the fourth terms as the first group, the sixth and the  seventh 
terms as the second group, and the fifth and eighth terms as the third group. The 
differences are revealed when comparing them to the two countries’ GDP. More 
precisely, a country’s GDP is the sum of its value-added exports plus its domestic 
value added consumed at home:
(15)   GDP 1  =  v 1   x 1  =  v 1 ( b 11   y 12  +  b 12   y 22  +  b 12   y 21  +  b 11   y 11 )
 =  v 1  { b 11   y 12  +  b 12   y 22  + [ b 12   y 21  +  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ]}
 +  v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 
(16)   GDP 2  =  v 2   x 2  =  v 2 ( b 21   y 11  +  b 22   y 21  +  b 21   y 12  +  b 22   y 22 )
 =  v 2  { b 21   y 11  +  b 22   y 21  + [ b 21   y 12  +  b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ]}
 +  v 2 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22  .
The last term in each GDP equation is value-added produced and consumed at home 
that are not related to international trade; while the first four terms in the bracket in 
each GDP equation are exactly the same as the first four terms in equations ( 13) and 
(14). It is easy to show that the sum of global GDP always equals global final demand:
(17) GD P 1  +  GDP 2  =  v 1   x 1  +  v 2   x 2  = (1 −  a 11  −  a 21 ) x 1  + (1 −  a 12  −  a 22 ) x 2 
 =  x 1  −  a 11   x 1  −  a 12   x 2  +  x 2  −  a 21   x 1  −  a 22   x 2  =  y 1  +  y 2  .
Equations (15) and ( 16) show that the third and fourth terms in equations ( 13) and 
(14) are counted as part of the home country’s GDP ( even though they are not part 
of the home country’s exports of value added) . Because they represent a country’s 
domestic value added that is initially exported but imported back and consumed in 
the initial producing country, they are part of the value added created by domestic production factors. The sixth and seventh terms represent the foreign value added in a country’s exports that are ultimately absorbed in the foreign country. They are counted 
once as part of the foreign country’s GDP in equations ( 15) and ( 16). In comparison, 
because a combination of the part of GDP that is consumed at home and exports of 
value added yields 100 percent of a country’s GDP, the fifth and eighth terms are not part of either country’s GDP. In this sense, they are “pure  double-counted terms.”
Subtracting global GDP from global gross exports using equations (13), (14), 
(15), and (16) yields the following:
(18)  
e 12  +  e 21   −  GD  P 1   −   GDP 2  =  v 1  [ b 12   y 21  +  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ]
  +  v 2  [ b 21   y 12  +  b 21   a 12  (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ]
  + 2 v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12   +  2 v 2   b 21   a 12  (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21 
  − [ v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11  +  v 2 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ].
470
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
Equation (18) shows clearly that besides the value added produced and consumed at 
home (in the last square bracket), which is not a part of either country’s gross exports, 
the sixth and seventh terms in equation (13),  v 2 [ b 21   y 12  +  b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ],  
and the sixth and seventh terms in equation (14)  v 1 [ b 12   y 21  +  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ],  
are double counted only once as foreign value added in the other country’s gross 
exports. Because the third and fourth terms in (13) and (14) reflect part of the coun-
tries’ GDP, they are not double counted from the global GDP point of view. In com-
parison, both the fifth and eighth terms are counted twice relative to the global GDP since they are not a part of either country’s GDP.
Third, the nature of the fifth and eighth terms can be better understood if we break 
them up further. In particular, with a bit of algebra, they can be expressed as linear combinations of components of the two countries’ final demand:
(19)   v 
1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12 
    =  b 12   a 21 [ v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22  +  v 1   b 12   y 21  +  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ]
(20)4 v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21 
   =  b 21   a 12 [ v 2   b 21   y 11  +  v 2   b 22   y 21  +  v 2   b 21   y 12  +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ].
The four terms inside the square bracket on the RHS of equation (19) are exactly 
the same as the first four terms in the gross exports accounting equation  (13). A 
similar statement can be made about the four terms inside the square bracket in 
equation  (20) to gross export accounting equation  (14). This means that the fifth and 
the eighth terms double count a fraction of both a country’s value-added exports and its domestic value added that has been initially exported but are eventually returned home. Just to belabor the point, unlike the other terms in equation  (13) that are parts 
of some countries’ GDP, the fifth and the eighth terms over-count the values that are already captured by other terms in gross exports. Again, this feature suggests that they are “pure double-counted terms.”
Note, if Country 2 does not export any intermediate goods, then  a 
21  =  b 21  = 0, and 
the entire RHS of equations (20) and (19) would vanish. Alternatively, if Country 1 does not export intermediate goods, then  a 
12  =  b 12  = 0, the entire RHS of equations 
(19) and (20) would also vanish. In other words, the fifth and eighth terms exist only 
when two-way trade in intermediate goods exist so that some value added is shipped 
back and forth as a part of intermediate trade between the two countries. Because the 
eight components of equations (13) and (14) collectively constitute 100 percent of 
a country’s gross exports, missing any part, including the two pure double-counted terms, would yield an incomplete accounting of the gross exports.
Finally, while the fifth and eighth terms in equation  (13) are (double-counted) val -
ues in intermediate goods trade that are originated in Countries 1 and 2, respectively, 
we cannot directly see where they are absorbed. By further partitioning the fifth and 
4 Proofs of equations (18), (19), and (20) are provided in online Appendix A.
471

eighth terms, we can show where they are finally absorbed and interpret the absorp-
tion by input/output economics. With a bit of algebra, we can show5
(21)   v 1   b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12  +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21 
    =   a 12 [ b 21   y 12  +  b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ] 
  +  a 21 [ b 12   y 21  +  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ].
Therefore, the sum of fifth and eighth terms in equation  (13) is equivalent to the 
sum of the four terms in the RHS of equation  (21). From equation  (5), it is easy 
to see that the terms in the square bracket in equation  (21) are parts of  x 22  and  x 11 ,  
which are trade-related portions of gross output that are both originally produced 
and finally consumed in the source country; therefore they are part of each country’s 
gross intermediate exports ( a 12   x 2  and  a 21   x 1 ). Since the value added embodied in 
those intermediate goods are already counted once in the production of each coun-
try’s GDP (the third and fourth, terms in equations (13) and (14)), they are double 
counted in value-added (GDP) terms. As we pointed earlier, the exact same terms will also appear in Country 2’s official exports statistics.
Due to the presence of these types of conceptually different double counting 
in a country’s gross exports, we may separately define “domestic value added in exports”(part of a country’s GDP in its exports) and “domestic content in exports.” The former excludes the pure double-counted intermediate exports that return home; 
whereas the latter is the former plus the pure double-counted term.
C. Using the Accounting Equation to Generate Measures  
of Vertical Specialization
We can relate the definitions of the three concepts to components in  equation  (13). 
Country 1’s exports of value added are the sum of the first and the second term. 
It takes into account both where the value is created and where it is absorbed. Country 1’s value added in its exports is the sum of its exports of value added and the 
third and the fourth terms. This concept takes into account where the value is created but not where it is absorbed. Obviously, Country 1’s “value added in its exports” is 
generally greater than its “exports of value added.” Finally, the domestic content in 
Country 1’s exports is Country 1’s value added in its exports plus the fifth term, the double-counted intermediate goods exports that are originated in Country 1. This last concept also disregards where the value is ultimately absorbed. By assigning the fifth term to the domestic content in Country 1’s exports, and the eighth term to the 
foreign content in Country 1’s exports, we can achieve the property that the sum of 
the domestic content and the foreign content yields the total gross exports. We will justify these definitions in what follows.
We already show that the first two terms in equation  (13) correspond to  value-added 
exports as proposed in Johnson and Noguera ( 2012) . We now link other  measures in 
5 A step-by-step proof is in online Appendix A.
472
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
the literature to linear combinations of the components in the same gross exports 
accounting equation. Following HIY’s original ideas, Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2008 and 2012)  have shown that gross exports can be decomposed into domes-
tic content and foreign content/ vertical specialization ( VS) in a single country IO 
model without two-way international trade in intermediate goods. If we were to maintain HIY’s assumption that Country 1 does not export intermediate good ( i.e., 
 a 
12  =  b 12  = 0), then the two pure double-counted terms, or the fifth and the eighth 
terms in equation  (13) are zero. In this case, we can easily verify that the sum of the 
last four terms in equation  (13) is identical to the VS measure in the HIY ( 2001)  paper.
To remove the restriction that HIY imposed on intermediate trade, we have to 
determine how to allocate the two pure double-counted terms. We choose to allo-
cate the double-counted intermediate exports according to where they are originally produced. That is, even though the fifth term in equation  (13) reflects pure double 
counting, it nonetheless is originally produced in Country 1 and therefore can be treated as part of Country 1’s domestic content. Similarly, we allocate the eighth 
term to the foreign content in Country 1’s exports. Such a definition is consistent 
with HIY’s original idea that a country’s gross exports consist of either domestic or foreign content and the major role of their VS measure is to quantify the extent to which intermediate goods cross international borders more than once. It is also computationally simple because the share of domestic and foreign content can be 
obtained directly from the VB matrix.
However, since the fifth term reflects double-counted intermediate goods in a 
country’s gross exports, we may wish to exclude it if we are to consider which part 
of Country 1’s GDP is exported. In particular, we define “domestic value added in Country  1’s gross exports” ( regardless of where the exports are ultimately 
absorbed)  as the sum of the first four terms on the RHS of equation  (13). This vari-
able can be shown to equal  v 
1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12 , part of equation  (12), Country 1’s 
gross output identity.
(22) D V 1  =  v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12  =  v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1 (  y 12  +  a 12   x 2 )
 =  v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1  [  y 12  +  a 12 ( b 21   y 11  +  b 22   y 21  +  b 21   y 12  +  b 22   y 22 )]
 =  v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1  [(1 +  a 12   b 21 )  y 12  +  a 12 ( b 21   y 11  +  b 22   y 21  +  b 22   y 22 )]
 =  v 1 (1 −  a 11  ) −1  {(1 −  a 11 ) b 11   y 12  + (1 −  a 11 ) b 12 (  y 21  +  y 22 ) 
 + [(1 −  a 11 ) b 11  − 1]  y 11 }
 =  v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22  +  v 1   b 12   y 21  +  v 1 [ b 11  − (1 −  a 11  ) −1 ]  y 11 
 =  v 1   b 11   y 12  +  v 1   b 12   y 22  +  v 1 [ b 12   y 21  +  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   y 11 ].
The derivation uses the property of inverse matrix (1 −  a 11 ) b 11  = 1 +  a 12   b 21  and 
(1 −  a 11 ) b 12  =  a 12   b 22 .
473
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
Following the same frame of thinking, we label only the sum of the sixth and sev-
enth terms, a subset of the foreign content, as the “foreign value added in Country 1’s 
exports,” and define Country 1’s VS as
(23)  V S 1  =  v 2   b 21   e 12  =  v 2 [ b 21   y 12  +  b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 22 ]
 +  v 2   b 21   a 12 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   e 21  
 = (1 −  v 1   b 11 )  e 12  .
The first two terms are foreign value added or GDP in Country 1’s exports, and VS 
share of Country 1 equals  v 2   b 21 . Therefore, such a measure of foreign content is a 
natural extension of HIY’s VS measure in a two-country world with unrestricted 
intermediate goods trade. Because the VS share is defined this way, it is natural to 
define the domestic content share in Country 1’s exports as 1 − VS share or  v 1   b 11 .
In a two-country world, Country 1’s VS1 is identical to its VS1* and Country 2’s VS:
(24) VS 1 1  = VS 1  1  * 
 =  v 1   b 12   e 21  =  v 1 [ b 12   y 21  +  b 12   a 21 (1 −  a 22  ) −1   y 11 ] +  v 1   b 12   a 21 (1  −   a 11  ) −1   e 12 ,
which is the sum of the third, fourth, and fifth terms in equation  (13). However, in a 
multi-country setting to be discussed later, VS1* will only be a subset of VS1, and 
the latter will also include some third country terms.
D. Numerical Examples
To enhance the intuition for our approach, we provide some numerical examples.
Example 1 ( Two Countries, One Sector, and Only One Country Exports 
Intermediate Good) :
Consider a world consisting of two countries (USA and CHN) and a single sec-
tor of electronics. The two countries have identical gross exports and identical 
 value-added exports (and hence identical V AX ratios). The point of this example is 
to show that the structure of the “double-counted” values in gross exports contains useful information.
Both USA and CHN have a gross output of 200. USA’s total output consists of 
150 units of intermediate goods (of which, 100 units are used at home and 50 units are exported) and 50 units of final goods (of which 30 are consumed at home and 20 are exported).
CHN’s total output consists of 50 units of intermediate goods (all used at home) 
and 150 units of final goods (of which, 70 units are exported and 80 units are used 
at home). By construction, both countries export 70 units of their output (50 units 
of intermediate goods + 20 units of final goods exported by USA, and 70 units of final goods exported by CHN).
The domestic value added in USA’s output is therefore 100 (=  value of gross 
output 200-value of domestic intermediate good of 100). Note no foreign value is 
474
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
used in USA’s production. The domestic value added in CHN’s output is also 100 
(= value of gross output 200-value of domestic intermediate goods of 50 + value 
of imported intermediate goods of 50). The input-output relationship can be sum-
marized as follows:
 x 1 
=200
 ,A =0.5 0.25
 ,V =0.5 0
 .
 x 2 200 00.25 00.5
The two-country production and trade system can be written as an inter- country 
input output (ICIO) model as follows:
  x 1 
=0.5 0.25 200
+30 + 20
. x 2 00.25 200 70 + 80
The Leontief inverse matrix and the VB matrix can be computed easily as
 B = b 11  b 12 
=20.67
, VB = 10.33
.
 b 21  b 22 01.33, 00.67
We can break up each country’s gross output according to where it is ultimately 
absorbed by rearranging each country’s final demand as follows:
 x 11  x 12 =20.67 3020=60 + 46.69 40 + 53.3=106.7 93.3
 .
 x 21  x 22 01.33 7080 0 + 93.33 0 + 106.67 93.3 106.7
It is easy to verify that  x 1  =  x 11  +  x 12  and  x 2  =  x 21  +  x 22 . USA’s value-added 
export is 46.7 ( v 1   x 12  = 0.5 × 93.33) , where 20 (=  v 1   b 11   y 12  = 0.5 × 2  × 20, 
first term in equation  (13)) is the amount of USA’s value added in its export of 
final goods that is absorbed in CHN, and 26.7(=   v 1  b 12   y 22  = 0.5 × 0.667 × 80, 
second term in ( 13)) is the amount of USA’s value added in its export of inter -
mediate goods that is also absorbed in CHN. The amount of USA’s value added 
that is embedded in its export of intermediate goods but returns home as part 
of CHN’s export of final goods is 23.3 (=  v 1   b 12   y 21  = 0.5 × 0.667 × 70, the 
third term in ( 13)). Using the terminology of Daudin, Rifflart, and Schweisguth 
(2011) , USA’s VS1* = 23.3, the same as the estimates from our accounting 
equation ( 13).
By construction, foreign value added in USA’s exports equals zero (since CHN 
does not export intermediate goods by assumption). It is easy to verify that the sum 
of USA’s exports of value added (46.7) and the amount of returned value added (23.3) is 70, which is the value of its gross exports.
For CHN, its value-added exports ( that are absorbed in USA)  are also 46.7  
(=  v 
2   b 22   y 21  = 0.5 × 1.333 × 70, first term in equation  (14)). It is entirely 
475
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
 embedded in CHN’s exports of final goods to USA. However, CHN does import 
intermediate goods from USA to produce both goods consumed in CHN and goods exported to USA. The amount of USA’s value added used in the pro-
duction of CHN’s exports is 23.3 (=  v 
1   b 12   y 21  = 0.5 × 0.667 × 70, the sixth 
term in equation  (14)). The sum of CHN’s exports of value added ( 46.7)  and 
the foreign value added in its exports (23.3)  is 70, which is the same as CHN’s  
gross exports.
In this example, both countries have identical gross exports and exports of 
value added, and therefore identical V AX ratios. However, the reasons underlying 
why value-added exports deviate from the gross exports are different. For USA, the V AX ratio is less than one because some of the value added that is initially exported returns home after being used as an intermediate good by CHN in the 
latter’s production for exports. For CHN, the V AX ratio is less than one because its 
production for exports uses intermediate goods from USA which embeds USA’s value added.
In addition, the double-counted items are also value added at some stage of pro-
duction. More precisely, the VS in CHN’s exports (23.3) is simultaneously a true 
value added from USA’s viewpoint as it is value added by USA in its exports to 
CHN (that returned home), but a “double-counted item” from CHN’s viewpoint as 
it is not part of CHN’s value added.
Since we assume that CHN does not export intermediate goods (or  a 
21  = 0 and  
b 21  = 0), there is no channel for CHN’s gross output to be used by USA in its pro-
duction and for CHNs gross output to be first exported and then returned home. 
Therefore, our gross exports accounting equation produces the same estimate for 
VS as the HIY’s formula, i.e.,
  v 2  (1 −  b 11 ) =  v 2   b 21   e 12  = 0.5 × 0.667 × 70 = 23.3 
 =  a 21 (1 −  a 11  ) −1   e 12  = 0.25 × (1 − 0.25 ) −1  × 70 = 23.3.
Domestic value-added share for CHN’s exports equals (70 − 23.3)/70 = 0.667 
=  v 2   b 22  = 0.667. There is no difference between HIY’s measure and our method in 
such a case since there are no pure double-counting terms due to two way trade in intermediate goods. Both VS in USA and VS1
* in CHN are zero. But this equality 
will not hold when we remove the assumption of  a 21  = 0.
However, because there is domestic value added embodied in USA’s intermediate 
goods exports that is eventually returned home, the domestic value-added share in 
USA’s exports equals to 1. As a result, using the V AX ratio (0.667) as a metric of the 
share of home country’s domestic value added in its gross exports would produce an 
underestimate. The corresponding ICIO table and more computation details can be found in online Appendix C.
Example 2 (Different Sequences of Trade for Same Final Goods Consumption 
and Same Value-Added Contribution from Each Source Country):
Imagine the United States trades in a good that has $1 million of US value added 
plus $100,000 of value added from each of other five countries before the final good, 
476
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
priced at $1.5 million, is consumed in the United States. Let us consider two differ -
ent production sequences of the supply chains.
Case 1:  If each of the five countries sends the parts sequentially between them 
for assembly before they enter the United States, then total trade will be $100K +  
$200K + $300K + $400K + $500K = $1.5 million.
Case 2:  If the United States exports its part first, then the production proceeds 
sequentially and the final goods produced by the production chain are shipped back 
to the United States, the total trade will be $1 million + $1.1 million + $1.2 mil-
lion + $1.3 million + $1.4 million + $1.5 million = $7.5 million.
Both cases yield the same value added but different amounts of gross trade. 
However, the two sequences of trade will correspond to two different inter-coun-try input-output ( ICIO)  tables. We can attach concrete labels to the final product 
and the inputs to get more economic intuition. Let us think of the final product 
as a Barbie doll, and the inputs as hair ( made by the United States) , head, body, 
hat, clothes, and shoes, respectively. The information about the sequence of the 
production is embedded in the direct input-output matrix A. In the first case, if the hair is attached by the United States at the last stage of production, it is an input to the “doll” industry. While in the second case, if the hair is first exported to the 
country producing “head,” attached to the “head” there, and re-exported to the 
next stage of production, it becomes an input to the “head” industry. The two dif-ferent organizations of the spatial and temporal connections of hair to head show up in changed entries to the ICIO matrix, with inputs of hair to the “doll” industry  falling in the former  recipient country ICIO coefficient in the first case, but inputs 
of hair rising in the second country’s “head” industry and measured inputs of 
heads (now bulked up with the hair value)  rising in all head-using industries in all 
countries downstream from the initial head-producing country to the final “doll” 
industry that uses heads. While a change in the first country’s hair inputs from the final country’s doll industry to the second country’s head industry in the direct I-O matrix A, the inverse ( direct plus indirect request)  matrix B will still capture that 
the hair arrived via the heads. Due to the less direct route of hair to dolls is raising measured inputs in all subsequent stages, as well as in the trade statistics, this case clearly shows a rise in gross imports and exports for those downstream of the head industry with only a redirection ( not an increase)  in exports of hair even though 
value added is constant by assumption.
In online Appendix C, we show how ICIO tables can be constructed for each 
of the two cases. In each case, our decomposition formula decomposes the gross exports into value added by each source country  plus additional double-counted terms. The results are reported in Table 1. Because these are very simple examples, we can also decompose the gross exports in each case by economic intuition (see Table 2). The results are identical to what our decomposition formula generates. 
However, our analytical formula not only clearly shows the structure of a country’s 
value-added exports (exports in final goods (v1), in intermediate goods (v2), and indirect exports via third countries (v3)), but also further splits the overall double counted amount to what is domestic value added initially exported and eventually

returning home (v4), what is foreign value added (v7), and what is double counted 
due to intermediate goods imported from foreign countries (v9). The additional detail provides more information about the structure of both the value-added and 
the double-counted trade. A more detailed two-country  supply chain example is 
provided in online Appendix D with additional economic intuition.Table 1— Decomposition of Gross Exports in Different Organization of Global Production Chain for

E. The General Case of G Countries and N Sectors
We now discuss the general case with any arbitrary number of countries and sec-
tors. The ICIO model, gross output decomposition matrix, value added by source 
shares matrix, are given succinctly by block matrix notations:

with G countries and N sectors, A, and B are GN × GN matrices; V and VB are 
G × GN matrices.  V s  denotes a 1 × N row vector of direct value-added coeffi-
cient,  A sr  is a N × N block input-output coefficient matrix,  B sr  denotes the N × N 
block Leontief inverse matrix, which is the total requirement matrix that gives the 
amount of gross output in producing country  s required for a one-unit increase in 
479
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
final demand in destination country  r.  X sr  is a N × 1 gross output vector that gives 
gross output produced in s and absorbed in r.  X s  =  ∑  r  G   X sr  is also a N × 1 vector 
that gives country  s’ total gross output.  Y sr  is a N × 1 vector give final goods pro-
duced in s and consumed in r.  Y s  =  ∑  r  G   Y sr  is also a N × 1 vector that gives the 
global use of s’ final goods. Both the gross output decomposition and final demand 
matrix in equation (26) are GN × G matrices.
Let     V  s  be a N × N diagonal matrix with direct value-added coefficients along 
the diagonal. ( Note      V  s  has a dimension that is different from  V s .) We can define a  
GN × GN diagonal value-added coefficient matrix as
(28)
   V  =    V  1 0⋯ 0
 . 0     V  2 ⋯ 0
⋮⋮⋱ ⋮
0 0⋯     V  G 
Using the similar intuition as we used to derive equation  (9) in the two-coun-
try one sector case, we can obtain domestic value added in a country’s gross out-
put by multiplying this value-added coefficient matrix with the right-hand side of  equation  (26), the gross output decomposition matrix. This will result in a GN × G 
value-added production matrix    V BY as
(29)    V  1 0⋯ 0  X 11  X 12 ⋯  X 1G 
0     V  2 ⋯ 0  X 21  X 22 ⋯  X 2G 
⋮⋮⋱ ⋮ ⋮⋮⋱ ⋮
0 0⋯     V  G  X G1  X G2 ⋯  X GG 
  =    V  1   ∑  r  G   B 1r  Y r  1     V  1  ∑  r  G   B 1r  Y r  2 ⋯     V  1  ∑  r  G   B 1r  Y r  G 
 .    V  2  ∑  r  G   B 2r  Y r  1     V  2  ∑  r  G   B 2r  Y r  2 ⋯     V  2  ∑  r  G   B 2r  Y r  G 
⋮ ⋮ ⋱ ⋮
    V  G  ∑  r  G   B Gr  Y r  1     V  G  ∑  r  G   B Gr  Y r  2 ⋯     V  G  ∑  r  G   B Gr  Y r  G 
Elements in the diagonal columns give each country’s production of value added 
absorbed at home. As in the two-country case, exports of value added can be defined 
as the elements in the off-diagonal columns of this GN × G matrix as
(30)   VT sr  =     V  s   X sr  =     V  s   ∑  
g   G
    B sg   Y gr  .

Obviously, it excludes value added produced by the home country that returns 
home after being processed abroad. A country’s total value-added exports to the 
world equal:
(31)  VT s*  =  ∑  
r  ≠ s  G
   V X sr  =  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     ∑  
g=1  G
    B sg   Y gr  .
By rewriting equation  (31) into three groups according to where and how the 
 value-added exports are absorbed, we obtain decomposition as follows:
(32)6 V T s*  =  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B ss   Y sr  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr   Y rr  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     ∑  
t≠s,r  G
    B sr   Y rt  .
This is the value-added export decomposition equation in terms of all countries’ 
final demands. The first term is value added in the country’s final goods exports; the second term is value added in the country’s intermediate exports used by the direct importer to produce final goods consumed by the direct importer; and the third term is value added in the country’s intermediate exports used by the direct importing 
country to produce final goods for third countries. Comparing with equation  (9), we 
can see clearly what is missing in our two-country case: it is the re-export of value 
added via third countries, the last term of the RHS of equation  (32), because the 
distinction between value-added exports from direct and indirect sources only can be made in a setting with three or more countries.
Define a country’s gross exports to the world as
(33)  E 
s*  =  ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    E sr  =  ∑  
r  ≠s  G
   ( A sr   X r  +  Y sr ) .
Using the logic similar to the derivation of equation (11), we can first decompose a 
country’s gross exports to its various components as follows:
(34)7 u E s*  =  V s   B ss   E s*  +  ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    V r   B rs   E s* 
 = V T s*  +  {  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr  Y rs  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr   A rs   X s  } 
 +  {  ∑  
t  ≠s   G
    ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    V t   B ts   Y sr  +  ∑  
t  ≠s   G
    ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    V t   B ts   A sr   X r  }  .
6 This value-added exports decomposition could also be done at the bilateral level; however, it is different from 
equation (15) in Johnson and Noguera (2012), who split bilateral gross exports to three groups.
7 The step-by-step proof is provided in online Appendix B.

KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
Based on the gross output identity for each country  X s  =   Y ss  +   A ss   X s  +   E s* ,  
we have,
(35)   X s  = (I −  A ss  ) −1   Y ss  + (I −  A ss  ) −1   E s* 
   X r  = (I −  A rr  ) −1   Y rr  + (I −  A rr  ) −1   E r  *  .
Replace  X s  and  X r  in equation  (34), insert equation  (32), we obtain the G country, 
N sector generalized version of gross exports accounting equation as follows:
(36) u E s*  =  {  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     B ss  Y sr  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     B sr  Y rr  +  V s   ∑

    ∑

    B sr   Y rt  } 
  +  {  V s   ∑

     B sr  Y rs  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     B sr   A rs (I −  A ss  ) −1   Y ss  } 
  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     B sr   A rs (I −  A ss  ) −1   E s* 
  +  {  ∑  
t≠s   G
    ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    V t   B ts  Y sr  +  ∑  
t  ≠s   G
    ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    V t   B ts   A sr (I −  A rr  ) −1   Y rr  } 
  +  ∑  
t≠s   G
    V t   B ts   A sr   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
   (I −  A rr  ) −1  E r  *  .
Equation  (36) has nine terms. It is very similar to equations (13) and (14) in the 
two-country case with only one main difference. It has an additional term, repre-
senting indirect value-added exports via third countries, in its value-added exports besides the two value-added terms that directly absorbed by the direct importer. 
Therefore, the first three terms are value-added exports (only two terms in the 
two-country case). The fourth and fifth terms, in the second bracketed expression, include the source country’s value added in both its final and intermediate goods imports, which are first exported but eventually returned and consumed at home, both of which are parts of the source country’s GDP but represent a double-counted 
portion in official gross export statistics, and have a similar economic interpretation 
as the third and fourth terms in equations (13) and (14). They differ from the two-country case in that we have to account for the domestic value added returning home from each of the G-1 countries here, not just from Country 2. The seventh and eighth terms in the third bracketed expression represent foreign value added (GDP) in the source country’s gross exports, including foreign GDP embodied in both final and 
intermediate goods. They differ from the sixth and seventh terms in equation  (13) 
in the two-country case in that equation  (36) further partitions each of the foreign 
value added (GDP) by individual country sources. There are also two pure double-
counted terms, the sixth and the ninth terms in equation  (36) as equations (13) and 
(14), but they sum up the double-counted portions of two way intermediate trade 
from all bilateral routes, not just between Country  1 and 2. The complete gross 
exports accounting made by equation (36) is also diagrammed in Figure 1.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
Figure 1. Accounting of Gross Exports: Concepts
Notes: (i) Value-added exports by a country equals (1) + (2) + (3); (ii) GDP in exports equals (1) + (2) +  
(3) + (4) + (5); (iii) Domestic content in a country’s exports equals (1) + (2) + (3) + (4) + (5) + (6); 
(iv) (7) + (8) + (9) is labeled as VS, and (3) + (4) + (5) + (6) is part of VS1 labeled by HIY (2001); (v) (4) is  
also labeled as VS1* by Daudin, Rifflart, and Schweisguth (2011); (vi) (4) through (9) involve value added that 
crosses national borders at least twice, and are the sources of multiple counting in official trade statistics.8
Similar to the two-country  case, measures of vertical specialization can be 
expressed as linear combination of the various components identified by equation 
(36) as follows:
(37)  D V s  =  V s (I −  A ss  ) −1   E s* 
 = V T s*  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr  Y rs  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr   A rs  (I −  A ss  ) −1   Y ss  ≥  ∑  
r   G
   V T s*   .
These are the first five terms in equation  (36) and it clearly shows that a country’s 
domestic value added in its exports is generally greater than its value-added exports 
in aggregate. The two measures equal each other only in the case where there is no returned domestic value added in imports, i.e., when both  V 
s   ∑  r  ≠s  G    B sr  Y rs  and 
 ∑  r  ≠s  G    B sr   A rs (I −  A ss  ) −1   Y ss  are zero.

it becomes foreign value in the direct importer’s exports. For this reason, it is not included as double counting to

which is composed of the last three terms in equation (36).
We can verify that equation  (38) is reduced to more familiar expressions in some 
special cases. Using a single country IO model, Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2008, 
2012) have shown
(39) VS share = u −  A v  (I −  A D  ) −1  = u A M (I −  A D  ) −1  .
In the G-country world,
(40)9 VS share =  ∑  
r  ≠s   G
    V r   B rs 
 = u −  V s   B ss  = u −  V s (I −  A ss  ) −1 
 −  ∑  
r  ≠s   G
    V s   B sr   A rs (I −  A ss  ) −1  .
The last term in the last step can be interpreted as the adjustment made for domestic 
content returned to the source country. Therefore, our foreign content measure 
of gross exports is a natural generalization of HIY’s VS measure in a multi-country setting with unrestricted intermediate goods trade. Because  
∑  r  ≠s  G    V r   B rs  +  
V s   B ss  = u, it is natural to define a country’s domestic content in its exports as:
(41)  D C s  =  V s   B ss   E s*  
 = V T s*  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s   G
    B sr   Y rs  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s   G
    B sr   A rs   X s  ≥ D V  s  ≥  ∑  
r   G
   V T sr  .
This is the sum of the first six terms in equation  (36).10 It shows that a country’s 
domestic content in its exports is generally greater than the part of its GDP in exports, 
and therefore is also greater than its value-added exports in the aggregate. The three 
measures equal each other only in the case where there is no returned domestic value 
in imports, i.e., when both  V s   ∑  r  ≠s  G    B sr  Y rs  and  V s   ∑  r  ≠s  G    B sr   A rs   X s  are zero.
The second HIY measure of vertical specialization (VS1) measures the value of 
the exported goods that are used as imported inputs by other countries to produce 
their exports. Although an expression for such indirectly exported products has not 
been previously defined mathematically in the literature, it can be specified based on some of the terms in our gross exports accounting equations.

THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
This means HIY’s VS1 can be expressed as the third term in (36) plus the third and 
fifth terms in equation  (34). The second term in equation  (42) measures how much 
domestic content in exported goods from the source country is used as imported 
inputs to produce other countries’ intermediate goods exports. It also shows clearly 
that HIY’s VS1 measure is generally greater than indirect value-added exports because the latter only includes the first term of (42), but excludes domestic content that is returned home and the value embodied in intermediate goods exports via third countries (they are already counted as other countries’ foreign content in these third countries’ exports), i.e.,
(43) I V 
s  =  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
     ∑  
t≠s,r  G
    B sr   Y rt  ≤ VS 1 s  .
Compared with equation  (24) of the definition of VS1 in the two-country case, two 
additional terms (the first two terms) appear on the RHS of (42) because of the third 
country effect.
(44) VS 1  s  *  =  ∑  
s≠t    
    V s   B sr   E rs  =  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr   Y rs  +  V s   ∑  
r  ≠s  G
    B sr   A rs   X s  .
As equation  (44) shows, we define VS1* as a subset of VS1 similar to Daudin, 
Rifflart, and Schweisguth (2011), but our definition differs from theirs as they 
include only domestic value added returned home in final goods imports (the 
first term in equation  (44)) but exclude domestic content returned home by being 
embodied in the imports of intermediate goods, the second term in equation  (44).11 
If one omits the second term, then VS1* would be inconsistent with the core idea of 
measuring vertical specialization from the export side, as it would fail to account 
for the source country’s exports used by third countries to produce their export of 
intermediate goods. It would therefore consistently under-estimate actual vertical 
specialization. To put it differently, the same domestic content embodied in a country’s intermediate goods exports manifests itself in international trade flows in two ways: (i) as foreign content in other countries exports, and (ii) as the source country’s indirect exports of domestic content via a third country. In other words, the foreign content in one country’s exports is the domestic content of another 
country embodied in its indirect exports. As an example, the Japanese content in 
the form of Japanese-made computer chips used in China’s exports of electronic toys to the United States represents foreign content in China’s exports, and it is also simultaneously Japan’s indirect exports of its domestic content to the United States. While these two perspectives produce the identical numbers when aggregating across 
all countries at the global level, their values for a given country can be very different. 
Therefore, when measuring a country’s participation in vertical specialization it is useful to be able to trace the two perspectives separately. This is also why HIY proposed two measures of vertical specialization, because a complete picture of vertical specialization and a county’s position in a vertical integrated production network has to involve both measures. Indeed, for a given country, the ratio of the

485
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
two measures provides insight for the country’s position in global value chains. 
Downstream countries tend to have a higher share of vertical specialization from the import side, i.e., higher foreign content (VS) in their exports, while upstream 
countries tend to have a higher share of vertical specialization from export side 
(VS1), higher share of exports via third countries. In addition, as we show in both equations (13) and (36), ignoring domestic content returning home via intermediate 
goods imports would leave the gross export accounting incomplete.
Therefore, equation  (36) provides a new way of thinking about the gross exports 
statistics. It demonstrates that various double-counted items in gross exports can 
be used to gauge the depth of a country’s participation in global production chains. 
Simply stripping away double-counted items and focusing just on value-added trade would miss such useful information. We have already provided numerical examples earlier to illustrate the intuition of this point; now we have laid out the accounting equation in a more general multi-country setting. It provides a transpar -
ent  framework that allows various value-added and double-counted components in 
a country’s official gross exports statistics to be correctly identified and estimated.
Equation  (36) (or Figure 1) also integrates the older literature on vertical special-
ization with the newer literature on trade in value added, while ensuring that the sum of value-added components from all sources and the additional  double-counted inter -
mediate goods exports (due to back-and-forth trade in intermediate goods) yields 
total gross exports. The previous vertical specialization literature only decomposes 
gross exports into two components: domestic and foreign content. In comparison, equation  (36) shows that a country’s domestic content can be further broken up into 
subcomponents that reveal the destinations for a country’s exported value added, including its own value added that returns home in its imports and what is double 
counted due to cross border intermediate goods trade. Similarly, equation  (36) also 
traces out the foreign content in a country’s exports to its sources.
Finally, note that we use a single subscript for the domestic content measure and 
two subscripts for the trade in value-added measure. This is to suggest that the trade 
in value-added measure holds for both aggregate and bilateral trade, while the gross export accounting equation we propose only holds for a country’s total exports to 
the world.
II. Data and Results
A. The Construction of an Inter-Country 
Input-Output (ICIO) Table and its Data Sources
To implement the above accounting method, we need an inter-country  input 
output (ICIO) table, that is, a database detailing international production and use 
for all flows of value added. The database should specify (i) transactions of inter -
mediate products and final goods within and between each country at the industry 
level, (ii) the direct value added in production of each industry in all countries, and 
(iii) the gross output of each industry in all countries. Such an ICIO table goes 
beyond a collection of single-country IO tables. It specifies the origin and destina-tion of all transaction flows by industry as well as every intermediate and/or final use for all such flows. However, these tables are not available on a global basis, and 
486
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
in fact are rarely available at the regional level. The available global databases, such 
as the GTAP Multi-Country Input-Output (MCIO) tables, do not have enough detail 
on the cross-border supply and the use of goods to be directly used to implement our 
methodological framework.
To provide a workable dataset and empirically conduct gross export decomposi-
tion, we construct a global ICIO table for 2004 by integrating the GTAP database 
(version 7) and the additional information from UN COMTRADE using a quadratic mathematical programming model. The model (i) minimizes the deviation of the 
resulting new dataset from the original GTAP data, (ii) ensures that supply and use 
balance for each sector and every country, and (iii) keeps all sectoral bilateral trade 
flows in the GTAP database constant. The new database covers 26 countries and 
41 sectors.
12
To estimate these detailed inter-industry and inter-country  intermediate flows, 
we need to (i) separate gross bilateral trade flows at the sector level in the GTAP database into intermediate, consumption, and investment goods trade flows, and 
(ii) allocate intermediate goods from a particular country source to each sector it 
is used within all destination countries. We address the first task by concording the 
three end-use categories defined by UN Broad Economic Categories (BEC) to the 6-digit HS level bilateral trade data in COMTRADE. This differs from Johnson and Noguera (2012) and Daudin, Rifflart, and Schweisguth (2011), who also transform 
the MCIO table in the GTAP database into an ICIO table. However, they do not use 
detailed trade data to identify intermediate goods in each bilateral trade flow, but 
apply a proportionality method directly to the GTAP trade data; i.e., they assume that the proportion of intermediate to final goods is the same for domestic supply and imported products.
The use of end-use categories to distinguish imports by use is becoming more 
widespread in the literature and potentially avoids some noted deficiencies in the proportionality method. Feenstra and Jensen (2012) use a similar approach to sepa-
rate final goods from intermediates in US imports in their recent re-estimation of the Feenstra-Hanson measure of material off-shoring. Dean, Fung, and Wang (2011) show that the proportionality assumption underestimates the share of imported goods used as intermediate inputs in China’s processing trade. Nordås (2005) stated that 
the large industrial countries have a higher share of intermediates in their exports 
than in their imports, while the opposite is true for large developing countries. These results imply that the intermediate content of imports differs systematically from the intermediate content in domestic supply.
In theory, less distorted intermediate share estimates will provide a better row total 
control for each block matrix of  A 
sr  in the ICIO coefficient matrix A, thus improving 
the accuracy of the most important parameters (the inter-country IO coefficients) 
in an ICIO model. This is why distinguishing imports by BEC may improve ICIO 
database quality over the proportionality assumption. To precisely assess whether 
and how much the BEC method improves over the proportionality approach, one would need the true inter-country  IO coefficients as a “reference point,” which unfortunately do not exist on a global scale. We will provide some evidence that the 
12 Tsigas, Wang, and Gehlhar (2012) provide details on the construction of the database. The longer working 
paper lists the countries/regions and sectors in our sample and their concordance to the GTAP database.

two alternative ways to identify intermediate goods from bilateral trade flows in the 
literature have a significant impact on trade cost when the magnification effects of multi-stage production are taken into account in one of our application examples.
B. Complete Accounting of Gross Exports
Table 3 presents a complete accounting of each country’s gross exports in 2004 
using equation  (36). The column numbers correspond to the order of each item in 
the equation and also the box numbers in Figure 1. The first three columns also cor -
respond to the three terms in the RHS of equation (32).
We compute all nine terms independently and verify that they sum to exactly 
100  percent of gross exports. The resulting estimates constitute the first such Table 3—Accounting of Gross Exports, 2004

 decomposition in a global setting and clearly highlight what is double counted in the  
official trade statistics. Column 15 reports the percentage of double counting by add-
ing columns 4 through 9. At the global level, only domestic value added in exports 
absorbed abroad are value-added exports. In addition to foreign content in exports, 
domestic content that returns home from abroad is also a part of double counting in official trade statistics, since it crosses borders at least twice. Such returned value added has to be separated from domestic value added absorbed abroad in order to fully capture multiple counting in official trade statistics. Therefore, for any coun-try’s gross exports, the double-counting portion equals the share of gross exports in 
excess of the value-added exports. We estimate this share to be about 25.6 percent 
of total world exports in 2004.
The accounting results reported in Table 3 also provide a more detailed breakdown 
of domestic content in exports than has been previously available in the literature. Table 3—Accounting of Gross Exports, 2004 ( Continued)

KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
The variations in the relative size of different components across countries provide 
a way to gauge the differences in the role that countries play in global production networks. For example, for the United States, the share of foreign value added in 
its exports was only 9 percent (columns 7 + 8), while its own GDP first exported 
then finally return home is large at 11.3 percent (columns 4 + 5), indicating that 
most of its exports reflect its own domestic value added. In comparison, for China’s 
and Mexico’s processing exports, the share of foreign GDP in their gross exports is 46.5 percent and 55.8 percent respectively, with an additional 10.1 percent and 7.6 percent of their gross exports coming from intermediate goods produced in for -
eign countries (column 9), indicating domestic value added accounts for less than half the value of both countries’ processing exports. More importantly, about half of the double counting in US exports reflected as 1-V AX ratio (column 11) in col-umn 15 comes primarily from its own domestic content returning home via imports 
(12.4 percent over 25.4 percent). In contrast, almost all of the double counting in 
China’s and Mexico’s processing exports comes from imported foreign content 
(56.6 percent over 56.9 percent and 63.4 over 63.7 respectively). These calculations highlight US exporters and Chinese and Mexican processing exporters’ respective positions at the head and tail of global production chains.
The structure of double-counted terms in each country’s gross exports listed in 
columns 4 through 9 offers additional information on how each country participates 
in vertical specialization and its relative position in global production chains. For 
example, for Western EU countries, about 40 percent of its double-counted gross exports come from domestic content returned home ( 7.4/18.9) . In comparison, 
for most developing countries, the foreign content tends to dominate, with only a very tiny portion of their domestic content returning home. Within foreign content, 
Maquiladora producers in Mexico, export processing zones in China and Vietnam, 
tend to have a large portion embodied in their final goods exports ( 37.6  percent, 
34.1 percent, and 24.4 percent, respectively) , reflecting their position as the assem-
blers of final goods in global production chains. For developed and newly industrial-ized economies, the shares in intermediate goods exports and the pure double-counted portion due to multiple border crossing intermediate goods trade are much higher. 
Similarly, upstream natural resource producers such as Australia and New Zealand, 
Russia, Indonesia, and Philippines, have a significant portion of their intermediate exports used by other countries to produce their intermediate goods exports. This is also true for upstream producers of manufacturing intermediates such as Japan.
To reiterate the connection of the nine basic components reported in Table 3 
to measures in the existing literature by numerical estimates, column 11 reports the value-added to gross exports ( VA X) ratio proposed by Johnson and Noguera 
(2012)  by adding up columns 1, 2, and 3; column 12 lists HIY’s VS share by sum-
ming columns 7, 8, and 9. Column 14 lists the share of domestic content exten-sively discussed in the vertical specialization literature by summing columns 1 through 6; Finally, column 16 gives the share of vertical trade by adding columns 
12 and 13, which is an indicator of how intensively a country is participating in 
the global production chain.
Comparing domestic content share estimates ( column 14)  and Johnson and 
Noguera’s V AX ratio (column 11)  reported in Table 3, we see interesting differences 
between high-income countries and emerging market economies. For most  emerging 
490
THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW FEBRUARY 2014
market economies, the numerical difference of these two measures is quite small. This 
means that only a tiny part of domestic content returns home for most countries. In comparison, for the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, the difference between 
domestic content share and the value-added export share is more significant. This 
reflects the fact that advanced economies export relatively more upstream compo-nents, and some of the value added embedded in these intermediate goods returns home as part of other countries’ exports to the advanced economies. Such differences between high-income countries and emerging market economies would not be appar -
ent if one does not compute the domestic content share and the V AX ratio separately.
III. Broad Implications for a Better Understanding of Global Trade
The decomposition results have implications for a variety of research and policy 
questions. In this section, to illustrate the potential importance of the decomposi-tion, we briefly discuss a few applications.
A. Revealed Comparative Advantage Index  
Based on Gross and Value-Added Trade
The concept of revealed comparative advantage (RCA), proposed by Balassa 
(1965), has proven useful in many research and policy applications. In  standard 
applications, it is defined as the share of a sector in a country’s total gross exports relative to the world average of the same sector in world exports. When the RCA exceeds one, the country is said to have a revealed comparative advantage in that sec-tor; when the RCA is below one, the country is said to have a revealed comparative disadvantage in that sector. The problem of double counting of certain value-added 
components in the official trade statistics suggests that the traditional computation 
of RCA could be noisy and misleading. The gross exports accounting exercise we proposed in this paper provides a way to remove the distortion of double counting by focusing on domestic value added in exports. Because domestic value added or GDP in a country’s exports describes the characteristics of a country’s production (total domestic factor content in exports), it does not depend on where the exports 
are absorbed. For those applications in which a production-based RCA is the right 
measure, we can use GDP in exports to compute RCA.
We re-compute the RCA index at the country-sector level for all the countries and 
sectors in our database. Due to space constraints, we select two sectors and compare the country rankings of RCAs using both gross exports and domestic value added 
in gross exports. In Figure 2, panel A we report the two sets of RCA indices for the 
finished metal products sector in 2004. Using gross exports data, both China and India show a strong revealed comparative advantage (ranked the first and fourth, respectively, among the set of countries in our database, and with the absolute values of RCA at 1.94 and 1.29, respectively). However, when looking at domestic value added in that sector’s exports, both countries ranking in RCA drop precipitously to 
seventh and fifteenth place, respectively.
13 In fact, for India, the sector has switched

metal products sector and then embodied in gross exports of all downstream sectors, rather than the value-added

from being labeled as a comparative advantage sector to a comparative disadvantage 
sector. Unsurprisingly, the ranking for some other countries move up. For example, for the United States, not only does its RCA ranking move up from tenth place under 
the conventional calculation to the third place under the new calculation, but its 
finished metal products industry also switches from being labeled as a comparative disadvantage sector to a comparative advantage sector.
Another example is the “real estate and business services” sector (Figure  2, 
panel B). Using data on gross exports, India exhibits a strong revealed comparative advantage in that sector on the strength of its unusually high share of business ser -
vices exports in its overall exports. However, once we compute RCA using domestic value added in exports, the same sector becomes a comparative disadvantage sector for India! One key reason for the change is that business services in advanced coun-tries are often exported indirectly by being embedded in these countries manufactur -
ing exports. Indeed, the RCA rankings for the United States, the European Union, 
and Japan all move up using data on the domestic value added in exports. Therefore, 
after taking into account indirect value-added exports, the Indian share of the sector in its exports becomes much less impressive (relative to other countries).
employed in upstream sectors that are used to produce finished metal products in the exporting country. This dis-
tinction is particularly important in the business services sector, discussed next.Figure 2. Value-Added-Adjusted Revealed Comparative Advantage Indicators

These examples illustrate the possibility that our understanding of trade patterns 
and revealed comparative advantage could be modified substantially once we have 
the right statistics.
B. Magnification of Trade Costs from Multi-Stage Production
As noted by Yi (2003, 2010), multi-stage production magnifies the effects of trade 
costs on world trade. There are two separate magnification forces. The first exists because goods that cross national borders multiple times incur tariffs and transpor -
tation costs multiple times. The second exists because tariffs are applied to gross imports, even though value added by the direct exporter may be only a fraction of this amount. Different ways of participating in global production chains affects the extent to which different countries are affected by such cost magnification. However, Yi (2003) does not actually measure the magnification of tariffs, though it is impor -
tant to his simulation exercise.
Our accounting method provides an ideal way to re-examine the magnification 
issue. In online Appendix E, we provide an illustrative calculation of the first order magnification effect of using imported intermediate inputs to produce exports. It r epresents the magnification effect if tariffs were the only factor that augments the 
trading costs. For instance, we find that one additional stage of production increases 
trade costs of Vietnam’s merchandise production by 80 percent of its standard tariff. 
Generally speaking, the magnification effect is stronger for emerging market econo-mies than for developed economies due to the lower domestic value-added share in most developing countries’ manufacturing exports. In the same Appendix, we also show that global ICIO databases constructed by the BEC end-use classification ver -
sus the proportionality assumption produce different trade cost magnification effects for a number of countries.
C. Other Applications
The set of examples discussed so far certainly does not exhaust the possible appli-
cations. For example, the Federal Reserve Board and the IMF routinely compute effective exchange rates using trade weights that are based on gross exports and imports. A conceptually better measure should weight trading partners based on the relative importance in value-added trade rather than in gross trade terms. Our decomposition results make it feasible to do such computations.
As another example, for some research or policy questions, one might need to 
look at the response of a country’s bilateral or multilateral trade to exchange rate changes. Once one recognizes that there is a potential mismatch between trade in value added and trade in gross terms, one would want to take this into account. Our decomposition allows for a correction.
As a further example, because a country’s gross exports embed value added from 
other countries, its bilateral trade balance in value-added terms can be very different from that in gross trade terms. By our estimation, because China is the final assem-bler in a large number of global supply chains, and it uses components from many other countries, especially East Asian countries, its trade surplus with the United States and Western EU countries measured in value-added terms is 41 percent and 
493
KOOPMAN ET AL.: VALUE-ADDED AND DOUBLE COUNTING IN GROSS EXPORTS VOL. 104 NO. 2
49 percent less than that measured in gross terms in 2004. In contrast, Japan’s trade 
surplus with the United States and Western EU countries are 40 percent and 31 per -
cent larger measured in value-added terms, because Japan exports parts and compo-
nents to countries throughout Asia that are eventually assembled into final products 
there and exported to the United States and Western EU countries.
IV . Conclusions
We have developed a unified conceptual framework that can fully account for a 
country’s gross exports by its various value-added and double-counted components. This new framework incorporates all previous measures of vertical specialization 
and value-added trade in the literature while adjusting for the back-and-forth trade of 
intermediates across multiple borders. With a full concordance between value-added and double-counted components and official gross trade statistics, it opens the pos-sibility for the System of National Accounts ( SNA) to accept the concept of value-
added trade without dramatically changing the current practice of customs trade data collection. This may in turn provide a feasible way for international statistical agen-
cies to report value-added trade statistics regularly in a relatively low cost fashion.
The creation of a database that encompasses detailed global trade in both gross 
and value-added terms will allow us to move from a largely descriptive empirical 
exercise to analysis of the causes and consequences of differences in supply chain participation. We show that conventional analyses involving revealed comparative 
advantage, bilateral trade balance, trade cost or effective real exchange rates can all 
benefit from our gross exports accounting results.
Better information at the sector level can improve our estimation. For instance, 
current end use classifications, such as the UN BEC, need to be extended to dual used products and services trade. In addition, methods also need to be developed to properly distribute imports to domestic users either based on cross country   statistical 
surveys or based on firm level and customs transaction-level trade data. We leave 
such sector level applications to future research.
