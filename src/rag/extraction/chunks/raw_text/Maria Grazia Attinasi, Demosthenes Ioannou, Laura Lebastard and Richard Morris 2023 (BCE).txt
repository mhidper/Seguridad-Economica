insights from a survey of leading companies

Although geopolitical risks and their effects on global production and trade are much debated,
little empirical evidence has emerged of increased fragmentation in global value chains.
Disruption caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Russian war against Ukraine and
increased geopolitical tensions across the board raise questions about whether we are witnessing a
trend towards deglobalisation. Most analysis to date does not find evidence of significant changes in
aggregate European trade patterns. Nonetheless, the ways that firms are adjusting their trading
relations and supply chain management may take time to unfold, given the challenges and costs
involved in modifying business models, supply chains and contracts.[] Survey evidence is therefore
helpful to identify new trends. To this end, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), the Banca d’Italia, the Deutsche Bundesbank and others have recently conducted surveys
asking firms about supply chain risks.[]
This box summarises the findings from a recent ECB survey of leading firms operating in the
euro area, focusing on their production-location and input-sourcing decisions, particularly in
response to supply chain risks.[] The firms surveyed are mostly multinationals with significant
operations in the EU, while most also have a large share of their activity outside the EU. Table A at the
end of this box summarises the sample in terms of extra-EU activity. The questionnaire had three parts,
covering questions related to (i) trends in the location of production/operations and their main drivers;
(ii) trends in input sourcing, dependency and supply chain risks; and (iii) the implications of these trends
for activity, employment and prices.
These large firms expect to become more active in (re)locating operations over the next five
years to make their businesses more resilient (Chart A). Companies were asked how the location of
their production/operations had changed over the last five years and how they expected it to evolve
over the next five years. The replies indicate higher shares of firms expecting to (re)locate more
production both into and out of the EU in the next five years than in the previous five years.[] But there
is still a higher proportion of companies expecting to move production out of the EU than into the EU. A
higher share of firms also said that they expected a tendency to (i) relocate more production
geographically closer to the final production site or country of sales (“near-shoring”), (ii) diversify
operations to a greater extent across countries, and/or (iii) (re)locate more production within/into
countries politically closer to the main country of sales (“friend-shoring”) in the next five years than in
the last five years.[] The near-shoring of production (or producing “local for local”) was already a fairly
common trend which is now expected to intensify.[] The friend-shoring of production, by contrast, had
not been so evident in the past but was expected to become much more commonplace – 42% of firms
envisage pursuing such a strategy, up from just 11% in the previous five years. Looking at the findings
in detail, it is primarily the firms that were already near-shoring or expecting to near-shore that now alsoECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 7/2023

broadly equally associated with firms saying they envisage moving more production into and those
saying they envisage moving more production out of the EU.

production/operations out of the EU, (iii) (re)locate more production/operations geographically closer to the final
production location or country of sales (“near-shoring”), (iv) diversify production/operations to a greater extent
across countries, (v) (re)locate more production/operations to countries politically closer to the main country of
sales (“friend-shoring”). The category “Neither into nor out of the EU” captures the responses of firms which did not
signal a tendency to move production either into or out of the EU.

into the EU, while demand and cost factors motivate moves out of the EU (Chart B). Firms were
given a list of factors and asked which of these were important for them in relation to recent or planned
future moves of production/operations into or out of the EU. Almost half cited geopolitical
risk/uncertainty as an important factor relating to recent or planned future moves into the EU. This
highlights a shift in firms’ priorities from simply focusing on cutting costs or improving efficiency to also
factoring resilience into their decisions. The next most important factor for moving into the EU was
climate change (transition to net zero). Regulation, financial incentives and local content requirements
were, broadly speaking, equally likely to be factors relevant for moves into or out of the EU. At the same
time, labour (cost/shortages/skills), energy costs and the changing geographical distribution of sales
were the main factors for moving production out of the EU.
As regards input sourcing, firms expect to increasingly near-shore, diversify and/or friend-shore
their supply chains in the next five years, with some increase in the share of sourcing from
inside the EU (Chart C). Companies were asked how the geographical distribution of their cross-
border sourcing of inputs had changed in the last five years and how they expected it to evolve in the
next five years. The replies indicate that a higher share of firms expect to increasingly source inputs
from inside the EU in the next five years than in the last five years, while there was no increase in the
share of companies saying they expected to source more inputs from outside the EU.[] A higher share
of firms said they expected to increasingly source inputs (i) geographically closer to the country ofChart B

from countries politically closer to the country of sales (“friend-shoring”) in the next five years than they
had in the last five years (up from 55% to 80%). Diversifying and near-shoring the sourcing of inputs
were already fairly common and were expected to become more so in the coming years. By contrast,
the friend-shoring of input sourcing had, as was the case with the location of production, not been
typical in the past but was expected to become much more so (with 42% of responding firms expecting
to pursue such a strategy compared with just 9% having done so in the past). The increase in the share
of firms expecting to pursue any or all of these strategies was negligible among firms who also said
they envisaged sourcing more inputs from outside the EU, but it was significant for firms who also said
they expected to source more inputs from inside the EU. Accordingly, an expected increase in the near-
shoring, diversification and/or friend-shoring of input sourcing appears to be tilting these firms, on
average, towards greater use of EU suppliers.

the supply of critical inputs from at least one of those countries was subject to elevated risk.[] In turn, a
large majority of these identified China as that country (or one of those countries), with all of them
considering this an elevated risk. Coming a distant second, only 8% of respondents said that their
company sourced critical inputs from the United States, and only 5% flagged this as a particular risk. As
to those countries which posed – or could pose – a risk to supply chains in their sector more generally,
two-thirds of all respondents cited China, while the United States, Taiwan, India, Turkey and Russia
were also each cited by more than 10% of respondents.
Most firms said that it would be very hard for them to substitute critical inputs originating from
countries deemed to be an elevated risk. Among the respondents who said that their company
sourced critical inputs (heavily or fully) from a specific country they considered an elevated risk, almost
two-thirds said that if those critical inputs were suddenly no longer available, replacing them with inputs
originating from elsewhere would be “very hard”, while nearly a third said it would be “hard” (Chart E,
panel a). In this context, two-thirds said that their company mainly sourced these critical inputs directly
from firms located in the country concerned, and one-sixth said that they mainly sourced them directly
from their own facilities in the country concerned, with the remainder sourcing them mainly via
distributors.8

country or countries concerned (Chart E, panel b). Among the same respondents who said that
their company sourced critical inputs (heavily or fully) from a specific country they considered an
elevated risk, only three said that they had neither adopted, nor intended to adopt, a strategy to reduce
their exposure. Almost 40% said that they were pursuing a strategy to mostly source the same inputs
from other countries outside the EU, 20% that they were pursuing a strategy to mostly source the same
inputs from other countries inside the EU, while 15% said that they were pursuing other strategies, such
as holding more inventory, diversifying their input sources, monitoring risk more closely, changing the
composition of their product(s) or closing down some production capacity. Just under 20% had not yet
adopted a strategy but were considering doing so in the near future.

accordingly .

panel b). In terms of activity, a large share of respondents said that these changes were likely to
influence the share of their company’s value added generated in the EU in the next five years
compared with the last five years. That said, those anticipating higher and lower shares broadly
balanced out. Respondents did, however, see the impact of these changes as increasingly negative for
the share of their company’s employment located in the EU. This would be consistent with companies
citing the cost of – and access to – labour and skills as the most important factor in their recent or
planned future decisions to move production or operations out of the EU.

greater extent have been unplanned and sudden (e.g. in response to the pandemic or Russia’s

28% of firms said they had near-shored production in the last five years, while 49% said they expected
to do so in the next five years. It is striking that this first number is identical to the share that, in a similar
ECB survey in 2016, replied that it had become more common in the past five years for companies in
their sector to produce/operate in the local markets where goods and services are sold. See the box
entitled “
”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 6, ECB, 2016.

This result is driven mainly by companies that are truly global (with more than 50% of their sales,
production and input sourcing presently outside the EU) and by companies that import (either
intermediate or final) products into the EU.

In the questionnaire, it was clarified that “By ‘critical’ inputs we mean goods without which a significant
part of your business activity could not be completed or would suffer significant delays or the quality of
the good or service produced by your firm would significantly decrease.” Respondents were asked to
indicate up to five countries, but most named just one or two.

In the questionnaire, it was stated that “Such risks could include the risk of sudden escalation of
economic or political tensions between countries (e.g. China and the US) resulting in bans on the
import or export of specific products, a tightening of local content requirements (e.g. in the context of
the EU/UK trade agreement), sourcing from countries at (risk of) conflict, risks stemming from climate
change…etc.”Global production patterns from a European perspective: insights from a survey of large euro
