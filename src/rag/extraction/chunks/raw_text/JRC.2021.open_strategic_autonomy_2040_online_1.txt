SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
Executive summary
The objective of this Science for Policy report is to present the results of the 
foresight process carried out on the future of open strategic autonomy. The re-
port describes trends and emerging issues looking at 2040 and beyond in a systematic 
and systemic way. It informs the 2021 European Commission Strategic Foresight Agenda 
and it provides foresight analysis and knowledge to the 2021 Strategic Foresight Report. 
Desk research was carried out, including a literature review, policy analysis and syntheses 
of existing knowledge on the current state of the EU’s open strategic autonomy and future 
possibilities in 2040 and beyond. Participatory foresight methods were employed to build 
collective intelligence on possible future developments, including the development of sce-
narios and an assessment of future policy options.
The importance of open strategic autonomy has been stressed in several Commis-
sion policy initiatives such as the trade policy review and update of the new indus-
trial strategy1. The concept includes the ambition for the EU to assume greater responsi-
bility for its own security, reduce one-sided dependencies in critical areas and strengthen its 
capacity to set and implement its own priorities. This concept has been brought to light by 
the Covid-19 pandemic, which has exposed vulnerabilities in Europe (e.g. disrupted medical 
supplies during the lockdown). Despite a variety of definitions, the literature indicates core 
features of open strategic autonomy that encompass notions of a current state of vulnera-
bility, dependency and gradual dis-empowerment, in contrast to a future state of enhanced 
resilience, managed mutual interdependence and relative power.
This report presents foresight scenarios on the global standing of the EU in 2040, 
in relation to open strategic autonomy. The scenarios were derived in participatory 
workshops with experts and stakeholders. They point to ways for the EU to build prepared-
ness through anticipation. A Delphi enquiry enabled the engagement of experts who as-
sessed and ranked the identified ‘forward-looking issues’ in terms of their relevance for 
shaping and securing the EU’s open strategic autonomy towards 2040.
Based on the results of the foresight process2, this report outlines potential im-
plications that could contribute to leveraging the EU’s capacity to move towards 
open strategic autonomy by 2040 and beyond. It addresses current weaknesses and 
upcoming challenges, pointing to underlying opportunities and implementing-priorities that 
will be required to shape and guarantee open strategic autonomy. The implications outlined 
should be considered as a set, in order to ensure the establishment of a coherent policy 
framework. The results are presented in a systemic way across five different areas3, i.e. 
geopolitics, technology, economy, environment and society.  
Identified geopolitical trends and opportunities for the future of open strategic 
autonomy:
• Increasing geopolitical competition provides opportunities for strengthening strategic al-
liances and alignment with like-minded countries and international organisations. These 
iv
include the transatlantic partnerships, bilateral and multilateral fora. There is space for the 
EU to play a role in facilitating and triggering discussions on possible reforms of interna-
tional institutions and organisations to better face current and future challenges. New and 
existing relations could be strengthened, for example inter-regional multilateral relations 
(e.g. with neighbourhood European countries, Africa, and the Middle East) by establishing 
win-win partnerships in ways that provide equal benefits to all involved parties. 
• Unclear evolution of the international order and hybrid threats provide opportunities 
for an expansion of the EU’s internal security and defence capacities. Political cohesion 
could provide the EU with greater influence and the ability to act jointly on defence and 
security matters, (for e.g. to ensure maritime, air space and outer space influence and 
cyber security) via diplomacy.
• Shifts in the future global landscape of powers calls for the EU to have a clear standing 
in relation to other important global players. This includes that the EU should define its 
approach toward the US-China rivalry, as well as its relationship with other emerging 
and developed global powers, whose future redistribution of geopolitical position is un-
clear (such as India, Africa, Russia and Latin America, as well as other Asian countries, 
e.g. Japan, Taiwan, South Korea). 
• Increasing global competition in standardisation provides opportunities for strengthening 
the EU’s power by using its accumulated excellence in the area, as well as by identifying 
and monitoring critical areas and technologies for future standardisation. It would give the 
EU a competitive advantage in terms of geopolitical power and positioning.
Identified technological trends and opportunities for the future of open strategic 
autonomy:
• Increased competition in the area of digital technologies provides opportunities to en-
sure the EU’s digital technology sovereignty through increased efforts in research excel-
lence and their translation into economic growth. This could be achieved through scaling 
up the EU’s start-ups in innovation-friendly ecosystems, and by keeping and attracting 
talent to the EU with the strong support of education and job creation.
• The pervasiveness of digital technologies in our lives calls for a joint approach to their 
governance through international cooperation with like-minded democracies. Regulatory 
frameworks could be designed in a way that fosters innovation in line with EU values 
and standards set to leverage the EU’s ability for leadership.
• Safeguarding Science, Technology and Innovation systems that could be disrupted in 
the years ahead, together with enhancing international partnerships and ensuring the 
competitiveness of researchers and the education system could be key for achieving 
digital sovereignty in the future. 
Identified economic trends and opportunities for the future of open strategic autonomy:
• Increasing global competition through the growth of emerging economies leads to a 
more fragmented economy. This new economic landscape provides opportunities for 
v
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
further leveraging the potential of the EU’s Single Market, smart specialisation and 
broadening global connectivity and value chains. 
• Foreign powers might progressively utilise economic dependencies for geopolitical rea-
sons and some global market players might become extremely powerful monopolies 
globally. That requires strengthening the resilience of the EU’s strategic economic as-
sets and industries, from Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to critical infrastructure, to 
avoid foreign control and rebalance economic power. 
• With the growing interdependence of the global economy and with major powers build-
ing on conflicting interests and values, there is an opportunity for the EU to enhance its 
ability to set common economic objectives and act independently. The EU’s capacity to 
act as a unified front would strengthen its position and enable it to safeguard its inter-
ests, such as global trade liberalisation and rules-based multilateral cooperation. 
• The international dominance of the US dollar in the financial system will be increasingly 
challenged. This opens the opportunity to reinforce the international role of the euro to 
enhance the stability and resilience of the financial system and increase the EU’s eco-
nomic sovereignty.
• The climate crisis and threat of ecosystems collapsing pose a growing risk of climate 
change-related economic losses and rising resource dependencies. To increase the EU’s 
economic resilience, a more inclusive and sustainable economic model (e.g. beyond 
GDP) would require further steps along the green and digital transition of the economy. 
The EU could profit from exporting a successful green and digital economic model to 
other world regions. 
Identified environmental trends and opportunities for the future of open strategic 
autonomy:
• Coordinated diplomatic efforts will be crucial to ensure that the green transition be-
comes a global effort. Thus, there is a huge opportunity for the EU to keep its leading 
role in climate diplomacy. This also includes maintaining the EU’s role as pace maker of 
the green transition and support to a global movement of responsible change.
• Climate change already affects Europe negatively. Adaptation to climate change is one 
way to manage climate risks. These efforts include the protection of critical assets from 
the negative impacts of climate change, such as flooding or droughts, and a strength-
ening of disaster prevention and coping mechanisms, capabilities and competencies.
• The green transition offers the opportunity to become a leader in emerging green tech-
nology sectors. Building on this opportunity, the green transition could become a catalyst 
vi
to modernise EU industry. Two possible opportunities are a continued pursue for renew-
able energy technology leadership and the implementation of a more circular economy. 
The latter would also reduce the dependency on imports of critical materials and goods.
• As a frontrunner in climate action, domestic EU companies might have a competitive 
disadvantage because of higher environmental standards than other global players. The 
industrial sector could be protected by implementing policy measures that can reduce 
the risk of carbon leakage and pave the way to industrial technology leadership at the 
same time. An example of such a measure is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
that was proposed by the European Commission.4 
Identified social trends and opportunities for the future of open strategic autonomy:
• Increased polarisation in society and populism show the need for participatory and inclu-
sive governance that enables co-design and co-creation of policy solutions and services 
with citizens to enhance trust and legitimacy at all levels of governance. Strengthening 
democracy in the EU and the EU’s position in the world by focusing on fundamental 
rights and values, could ensure fairness, justice and solidarity. 
• Digital skills and education are not equally offered across the EU regions. For the EU 
workforce to remain competitive in the future, defining key areas for training and re-
skilling is needed. This would require further investment in modernising the education 
system and skills needed for the future (e.g. digital skills, critical and analytical thinking, 
problem solving) and avoid brain drain through innovative education and attractive work 
profiles.
• In the context of the twin transitions, the focus of policy design would need to ensure 
adequate and fair support to people and industries. Social interventions could be applied 
when needed for successful transitions, to optimise positive transformations and mini-
mise negative disruptions in society (e.g. social safety nets).

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND

1Introduction
The Covid-19 crisis has brought to light the 
concept of open strategic autonomy. The crisis 
has underlined that to build a more resilient and ‘fu-
ture-proof’ Europe, the EU should be more aware of 
its critical dependencies. This report describes trends 
and emerging issues, looking forward at how they 
could evolve over time, and looking at the opportu-
nities and risks they entail. The process and results 
depicted in the present science for policy report un-
derpins the European Commission’s 2021 Strategic 
Foresight Report5. 
The concept of open strategic autonomy has 
emerged in a context of increasing global connectivi-
ty and multidimensional interdependence on the one 
hand, and assertive to aggressive competition on the 
other. Its core features include notions of a future 
state of enhanced resilience, managed mutual inter-
dependence and relative power evolving from exist-
ing capacities, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. 
While it originally focused on matters of secu-
rity and defence, open strategic autonomy has 
expanded to encompass a wide range of poli-
cies6. It extends from geopolitics and economics (i.e. 
critical raw materials and supply chains) to law (i.e. 
regulation and standards), technology, environment 
and climate, social and governance (i.e. manipula-
tion of data and misinformation). This extension has 
led to the indiscriminate use of a range of economic 
and technological tools to deliberately influence and 
at worse undermine rival political and economic sys-
tems. 
Strengthening Europe’s ability to play a more 
active role in the world is central to open stra-
tegic autonomy7. The results of the foresight pro-
cess underline that open strategic autonomy does not 
amount to seeking protectionism or isolationism. It is 
rather about equipping the EU to manage interdepen-
dence in line with its interests and values, and to deal 
with growing geopolitical competition. Hence, it is ‘a 
means to an end’, or to attaining the EU’s long-term 
objectives. A process rather than an end-point, and a 
dynamic rather than a rigid process8. 
In this report open strategic autonomy is un-
derstood as cutting across multiple policy ar-
eas. Policy instruments discussed and analysed can 
enhance Europe’s resilience, reduce its dependencies 
and ensure safety and security. Open strategic auton-
omy can also be perceived as contributing to a more ‘proactive’ agenda to enable Europe’s own choices 
through rule making and standard setting at the EU 
and multilateral level.
This foresight analysis highlights the need for 
an increased coherence in the EU’s open stra-
tegic autonomy related policies across domains 
and time horizons. These policies are those that can 
equip the EU with a stronger ability to manage in-
terdependences in line with its interests and values.  
Cross-cutting policy narratives ought to be robust 
and co-created with all the relevant stakeholders. 
Indeed, there is a growing need for a more system-
atic engagement of the public to ensure that policy 
narratives are clear on what this concept means for 
European citizens.
This report outlines future opportunities to 
achieve and secure open strategic autonomy in 
Europe by 2040 and beyond based on the current 
state-of-play. Results presented in this report have 
emerged through the foresight process described 
below (Figure 1), which was employed to bring for-
ward-looking evidence to the Commission’s Strategic 
Foresight Agenda 20219. The process ran between 
November 2020 and June 2021. The report begins by 
outlining the EU’s existing strengths and weaknesses 
with regard to open strategic autonomy, as well chal-

lenges and opportunities for maintaining it by 2040 
and beyond. This analysis is based on desk research 
and debates carried out with experts from across 
Europe and relevant European Commission services. 
It reviews current evidence in terms of the EU’s de-
pendencies, vulnerabilities, risks, capacities and ca-
pabilities. It presents the key trends and emerging 
issues that are likely to shape the EU’s open strategic 
autonomy in the future. The analysis was grouped 
and presented in five areas of open strategic auton-
omy: geopolitical (Chapter 2), technological (Chapter 
3), economic (Chapter 4), environmental (Chapter 5) 
and social (Chapter 6). These five areas allow taking 
a systemic and holistic approach to this multifaceted 
concept.
To be better prepared for uncertain future de-
velopments, a scenario analysis describes pos-
sible futures of the global standing of the EU 
and open strategic autonomy in 2040. The set 
of four scenarios provide a framework that provide 
a way to investigate the meaning and relevance of 
the EU’s open strategic autonomy in 2040 and be-
yond (Chapter 7). They bring forward four plausible 
futures and are meant to question our individual and 
collective assumptions about the past, present and 
future. These assumptions were gathered through an 
initial survey addressing EU Commission services and 
through dedicated workshops (Annex 1).
The report concludes with implications for le-
veraging the EU’s capacity to ensure its open 
strategic autonomy by 2040 (Chapter 8). These 
implications highlight the ways in which the EU could 
use its existing strengths and develop further ca-
pacities, both by itself and through alliances. It also 
points to ways of addressing current weaknesses and 
upcoming challenges, seize underlying opportunities, 
and implement identified priorities required to shape 
and guarantee the EU’s open strategic autonomy.

GEOPOLITICS
5Geopolitics
This chapter describes the key elements that currently shape the geopolitical aspects of the EU’s 
open strategic autonomy, both in the present and towards 2040. The infographic below depicts a sum-
mary of the EU’s existing strengths that are key to addressing current weaknesses and upcoming challenges, 
as well as for seizing opportunities. Building on the EU’s regulatory and standard-setting power, its active 
role in international partnerships and diplomacy and its governance model, is paramount for enabling the EU 
to leverage its global position and address emerging threats. This is both on its own and through strategic 
alliances in order to increase its soft power, security and defence capacity - which depend on a common EU 
geopolitical narrative, built upon a shared vision and set of priorities. We elaborate on these aspects in the 
subsequent sections.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDCurrent strengths and weaknesses
The EU has three key areas for improvement re-
garding its geopolitical stand. First, in the defence 
and security domain, coordinated priority setting is 
still required to guide cooperation and commitment by 
Member States. Second, a combined approach of cur-
rent and forward-looking analysis is key to clarifying 
Europe’s policy options. This is particularly important for 
resource and infrastructure dependencies and risks, as 
they can contribute to fine-tuning policy responses more 
effectively. Third, open strategic autonomy-related EU 
policies need to be framed around a common geopolit-
ical narrative, which both global players and EU citizens 
can understand and relate to. Taking on and advancing 
a responsible global change agenda could provide this 
framing and a clear, coherent, and attractive common 
policy narrative.
Three EU geopolitical strengths provide the basis 
on which to develop the above-required improve-
ments, to address upcoming challenges and seize 
their underlying opportunities. First, the EU strives 
to function as a role model in diplomacy deployment. 
The EU’s science, vaccine and climate diplomacy, as 
well as development cooperation, are important exam-
ples of its openness and active role in multilateral and 
bilateral partnerships, and in multidimensional diplo-
macy. Second, the EU still exerts important regulatory 
and standard-setting power. This power derives from 
the significant size of the European market (450 Million 
consumers), its political will, and citizen support to set 
rules and standards for its consumer markets. The EU 
thereby influences both foreign governments and multi-
national corporations to comply with EU rules. Third, the 
EU’s rule-based and multi-level governance model offers 
the right framework to advance open strategic autonomy 
via multilateral and rules-based cooperation grounded on 
effective and representative international institutions.
Need to advance the EU’s military power, de-
fence and security
Recently the EU has made some progress in de-
fence and security. It has set up arrangements to 
enhance coordination and cooperation among Member 
States in developing their military capabilities and ac-
quiring a stronger operational capacity. These include 
the Permanent Structured Cooperation, the Coordinated 
Annual Review on Defence and the European Defence 
Fund10. For the first time, it makes funding available un-
der the EU budget to support joint research and capa-bility development in the defence field. These arrange-
ments are expected to be mutually reinforcing and to 
connect to the successive cycles of the Capability De-
velopment Process. Furthermore, the EU’s Foreign Direct 
Investments (FDI) Screening Regulation has entered 
into force on the grounds of security concerns11 and to 
preserve Europe’s strategic interests while keeping the 
EU market open to investment12. Similarly, by fostering 
synergies among EU-funded instruments and facilitat-
ing civilian-space-defence cross fertilisation (spin-ins 
and pin-offs) it is possible to further develop the Single 
Market and improve EU citizens security13. However, the 
debate concerning the experience of the last few years 
points to the need for convergence and better priori-
ty-setting to guide cooperation and for more commit-
ment by Member States, as well as for a quicker and 
united response14.
The EU needs to improve its capacity on hybrid 
threats15. Currently, the EU’s approach is mainly a re-
active one to ongoing threats at EU borders, with a focus 
on Eastern and Southern territories. Countermeasures 
are focused primarily inwards, ranging from the digital 
economy to cyber, maritime, space and energy domains. 
These play a role in the security of the EU borders, its 
critical infrastructure and information flows. Howev-
er, efforts to increase the EU’s resilience and security, 
as well as to address vulnerabilities are still required. 
In this direction, the JRC has developed a conceptual 
framework together with the Centre of Excellence for 
Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE) to facilitate the 
early detection of hybrid threats, the identification of 
gaps in preparedness and response, and the develop-
ment of effective measures to counter this complex 
phenomenon16. Building trust and coordination among 
Member States, as well as the capacity to work sys-
temically across policy domains in order to anticipate 
challenges and risks, is key for effective strategies and 
responses to hybrid threats. 
The development of the EU Strategic Compass17 
2020-2022 will foster a common strategic ap-
proach to the EU’s security and defence policy and 
guide future EU work on development of EU De-
fence and security priorities and capacities. This 
two-year process, led by the European External Action 
Service under the responsibility of the EU high Represen-
tative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, aims to de-
velop a ‘Strategic Compass’ for its security and defence 
policy. It offers a more strategic and evidence-based 
approach for providing guidance and direction on com-
7mon European security and defence policy, with a view 
to tangible results. It builds on the common analysis 
of the threats and challenges facing Europe carried out 
in 202018, towards shaping a common EU security and 
defence culture19. Threats include conventional to trans-
national threats, including hybrid threats. They also re-
late to pervasive and persistent instability and conflict in 
the immediate vicinity of the EU and beyond. Ultimately, 
the EU needs to increase its operational effectiveness, 
further develop its civilian and military capabilities and 
strengthen its resilience, while also looking at ways to 
work with partners more closely20. Europe should also 
focus on reinforcing its defence capacity whilst secur-
ing access to global commons (including cyber, mari-
time and space), and improving early warning systems 
and strategic foresight, beyond promoting technological 
sovereignty and innovation.
The EU has limited capability regarding military 
power, defence and security. The EU lacks the legal 
competence to act on behalf of the Member States in 
spite of its spending in defence and the size of its col-
lective forces, which would make it a global power with 
one of the strongest militaries in the world21. This has 
left the EU dependent on the transatlantic partnership 
and NATO, and subject to the vagaries of an often-frag-
ile relationship. The debate on open strategic autono-
my has exposed different levels of ambition concerning 
Europe’s role in security and defence matters22. Many 
argue that Europe’s capacity to take more responsibility 
for its own security and that of others, in particular in the EU neighbourhood, is required for Europe to be able 
to advance its interests, values and agenda in a world of 
growing geopolitical struggles. At the same time, there are 
differences among Member States concerning the degree 
and implications of open strategic autonomy in defence.
Need for a combined actual and forward-look-
ing analysis of EU dependencies and risks
The EU’s one-sided dependencies in the supply of 
resources are a growing concern. These dependen-
cies are evident in resources that are both rare and crit-
ical for the EU’s current and future value chains. The re-
sulting vulnerabilities are increasing due to the growing 
politicisation of critical raw materials (CRM) and supply 
chains. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the EU’s 
vulnerabilities in relation to vaccines, medicines and oth-
er critical crisis-related supplies, as already highlighted 
in the Commission’s 2020 Strategic Foresight Report23.
The Covid-19 pandemic exposed dependencies 
and vulnerabilities regarding the concentration 
of medical and other supply chains in China and 
India. Ongoing research highlights the fact that the in-
tensity of globalisation is expanding the number of in-
terdependencies, making the global trade system highly 
vulnerable to the propagation of failures and sudden 
collapse24. Apart from resilience concerns, this has also 
drawn attention to the less desirable direction and ef-
fects of exploitative practices powered by globalisation, 
including manipulation of foreign aid, labour, currencies, 
taxes, subsidies, tariffs and other trade barriers. Open Figure 2. Main EU suppliers of CRM

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDstrategic autonomy marks a pushback on this exploit-
ative form of globalisation and not a shutdown of glo-
balisation in general. Indeed the effectiveness of such 
a pushback on exploitative forms of globalisation de-
pends on the strength of the global partnerships the EU 
can forge with like-minded countries. Looking forward, 
the EU needs to invest in circularity25, as well as re-
search and innovation on substitute materials to man-
age and reduce its current reliance on the raw materials 
required for the twin digital and green transitions more 
effectively.
The EU’s current approach to open strategic au-
tonomy approach has focused on supply risk for 
key EU strategic sectors and related value chains. 
The attention has been on those rare minerals and raw 
materials with a high criticality rating and which pose 
the highest supply risk. Recent analysis26 indicates that 
China is the largest global supplier accounting for 44% 
of critical raw materials (CRM) to the EU, while other 
countries account for the main share of specific CRM, 
including European countries (21%). Another report27 
comparing the significant strategic dependency of US, 
UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada on China, iden-
tifies up to 831 categories of goods and 216 categories 
of goods to service critical infrastructures. It proposes 
that decoupling from China could take three forms: neg-
ative, positive or cooperative, but that further analysis 
is required to determine the extent of structural depen-
dency.
Intermediate and final goods are an addition-
al source of EU dependency. Intermediate goods 
are those used in final production, and their sourcing 
is scattered across the globe28. Overall, the three main 
foreign sources of EU import value, for the 137 products 
identified as highly dependent, are China29, Vietnam and 
Brazil (Figure 2)30. “China represents around 52% of 
the total value of imports of the most foreign depen-
dent products and it is among the top three suppliers 
for around 54% of these goods. In terms of stages of 
processing, around 16% of the products for which we 
depend on foreign countries are raw materials, around 
57% are intermediate goods and around 27% are final 
goods”. Out of the 137 highly critical products identi-
fied, 99 are related to raw and processed materials and 
chemicals. Overall, 34 products are more vulnerable and 
have a low potential for diversification and substitution 
with EU production. They include various raw materials 
and chemicals used in energy-intensive industries and health (including active pharmaceutical ingredients). 
The dependencies on imported energy products are im-
portant to consider in the context of the decarbonisa-
tion of EU industry, to which hydrogen should become a 
key contributor. Finally, the analysis in the report reveals 
that the EU has a high level of foreign dependency with 
respect to 17 products related to renewable energy pro-
duction, green mobility (including batteries) and digital/
electronics (including semiconductors, cloud and edge 
computing).
The 2020 Action Plan on critical raw materials 
identified that lowering dependences for strate-
gic products will require a broader effort of trade 
diversification and partnerships31. Trade diversifi-
cation is not simple. The same geopolitical shifts that 
are pushing the EU to secure supplies are making di-
versification harder. The EU may need to prepare for an 
erosion of critical supply security in the future. Hence, 
looking forward the EU will have to cope with three ma-
jor factors that may shape its geopolitical environment. 
These are state fragility, economic coercion and climate 
change. Collectively, these three conspire to limit the 
number of available suppliers and partners for the EU’s 
more sensitive dependences. A strategy of diversifica-
tion may be applicable to raw materials or components, 
but not to other areas such as high-tech. Moreover, ex-
isting EU partnerships are a good foundation for diver-
sification, as it is developing new resource partnerships, 
public procurement and sustained financial investments 
in critical areas32. Finally, novel ways to source resourc-
es, such as space mining33 and seabed mining34 are be-
ing explored.
Infrastructure is an area of concern regarding EU 
dependencies and exposure. Undersea internet cables 
are among the critical infrastructures that are becoming 
a focus of growing geopolitical competition35 concerning 
who can build such internet infrastructure, and where. 
China and the US differ in their approaches, but both are 
racing ahead of the EU in their influence over internet 
infrastructures and those that depend on them. “The EU 
lacks an all-encompassing strategy for the sector, and 
individual governments are still the key players. Building 
capacity to set industry standards would help European 
telecommunications companies win business abroad, 
and protect internet infrastructure against hostile pow-
ers” 36 Moreover, connectivity together with the ability to 
engage with global partners is critical to exert influence 
in an interconnected world and, therefore, for open stra-
9tegic autonomy. This can be done through networks (e.g. 
digital, energy, financial) 37.
Space and other critical infrastructure may also 
be at risk. Strategic autonomy in space relies on the 
safety and proper functioning of space and terrestri-
al infrastructure (e.g. satellites and ground stations), 
as well as supplies of technologies, components and 
materials. However, to understand EU dependencies 
in this area requires an overall strategy that maps out 
infrastructure linkages, identifies vulnerabilities and 
develops a plan of action to manage resilience. There 
are three key elements to protecting space-based in-
frastructures: situational awareness, technological ad-
vances and regulation38. Recently, the Commission pro-
posed additional measures on critical EU infrastructures 
protection39, which is included in the Commission work 
programme 202040, based on a review of the European 
Critical Infrastructures Directive41. It indicates that the 
current framework, mainly in the transport and energy 
sectors, is inadequate in the light of increasing interde-
pendencies within, between and beyond these sectors. 
In addition, the evolving risks that they face, which may 
go beyond terrorism, man-made technological threats, 
climate change and natural disasters.
A combined approach of current and forward-look-
ing analysis is key to clarifying Europe’s policy 
options. Such analysis for resource and infrastructure 
dependencies are important to fine-tune policy respons-es more effectively. A JRC foresight report on critical raw 
materials42 ranks critical raw materials (CRM) in terms 
of importance, both in relation to their supply and their 
role in value chains. It indicates the extent to which these 
materials can be recycled and/or substituted, through 
innovation and technological advances. This type of on-
going analysis43 constitutes an essential prerequisite 
for designing more robust approaches to open strategic 
autonomy. In this regard, important developments are 
underway with the setting up of the European CRM Ob-
servatory and the Raw Materials Scoreboard44. This type 
of work needs to be broadened, deepened and extend-
ed in scope, and time horizon. Future analyses will also 
need to take account of variables such as new (circular) 
industry and sustainable business models, technological 
advances, environmental concerns and market demand, 
among others.
The EU’s active role in multilateral partner-
ships and multidimensional diplomacy
Multilateralism plays a key role in the EU’s open 
strategic autonomy45. Multilateralism is a core ele-
ment in the EU’s foreign policy and identity and a corner-
stone of its approach to peace and security. It is widely 
promoted by the EU to counter global threats, such as 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ter-
rorism and global health crises - including the econom-
ic and humanitarian consequences of the coronavirus 
pandemic across the world46. Strategic partnerships and Figure 3: Share of EU imports value of dependent products

p?id=37)

multilateralism are two sides of the same coin, rein-
forcing one another and the EU’s global standing. In ad-
dition, they are key to strengthening the EU’s ability to 
shape multilateral norms, institutions and regimes in pol-
icy areas in which it yields more power, such as trade and 
regulations. Multilateralism also depends on cooperation 
between rivals and the ability to define the parameters for 
the governance of global public goods47. This is illustrated 
by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)48.
The EU is playing out its role through multilat-
eral initiatives. In the case of global health policy in 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU together with the US, 
UK, and others are supporting equitable global access 
to vaccines through the World Health Organisation co-
led COVAX initiative. The ongoing ‘vaccine diplomacy’ 
has implications for the EU’s profile in and partnership 
with the Middle East and Africa. China and Russia have 
moved quickly to offer the vaccines they produce: China 
is supplying the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
and several African countries, and Russia has offered a 
number of doses to the African Union (AU). For China49 
this is also part of a larger approach – the Health Silk 
Road – which promotes China as a global health leader. 
The G7 recently committed to provide over two billion 
vaccine doses and to create appropriate frameworks to 
strengthen collective defences against threats to glob-
al health, including by shortening the cycle of vaccine 
development, as well as developing early warning sys-
tems and increased manufacturing capacity50. Through 
the COVAX initiative, the EU aims to facilitate access to 
a COVID-19 vaccine to millions of people in Africa, Asia, 
the Caribbean and the Pacific, and in Europe’s eastern 
and southern neighbourhoods51. 
Science diplomacy is another key area for EU pol-
icy-making that links foreign policy and science 
policy. It refers to the EU’s external engagement in sci-
ence and technology (S&T), in particular international 
activities to tackle global challenges and to foster soft  
power capacities, thus improving the EU’s external rela-
tions52. The debate includes the ways in which S&T can 
contribute to the EU’s security53. It is composed of three 
forms of external science activities54: 
1. science for diplomacy, or the use of science to 
advance diplomatic objectives; 
2. diplomacy for science, or the use of diplomat-
ic action to further scientific and technological 
progress; and3. science in diplomacy, or the direct involvement of 
science, or scientific actors, in diplomatic processes55. 
EU science diplomacy activities have been fruitful 
worldwide. This is true in the Middle East, in the Amer-
icas, in Asia, in Africa and in its eastern neighbourhood56. 
Recently, the EU has launched its strategy for internation-
al cooperation on research and innovation in a changing 
world57 with a view to strengthening its science diplomacy.
The EU’s regulatory power
The EU still exerts important regulatory power. It 
derives from both the significant size of the European 
market (450 Million consumers)58 and the political will 
(and citizen support) to set rules and standards for its 
consumer markets. The EU thereby influences foreign 
governments and multinational corporations who find 
it easier to comply with (unified) EU rules, rather than 
producing different products or services for different 
markets (and regulatory frameworks). The EU exerts 
this ‘superpower’ influence, not by imposing standards 
coercively, but via market forces59. However, it is import-
ant to keep in mind that EU regulatory power is strong 
relative to its rivals. Europe should strive to maintain 
and increase this power despite the fact that it may not 
prove to be easy to sustain. In fact, China has the mar-
ket power, but currently lacks similar regulatory capac-
ities and the US lacks the political will to use its power.
The EU’s strong regulatory power has become 
particularly significant recently. This is due to the 
prolonged impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 
global economy and the change processes underway as 
a result. Rule-making and standard-setting60 have ac-
quired strategic relevance because of their instrumental 
value and use in providing direction to global change, 
as different models of capitalism – more market driven 
and more state driven – as well as sets of norms and 
values co-exist and compete on the global stage. This 
is even more important at a time when Europe, and the 
rest of the world, face two structural transitions – green 
and digital – that need steering and adequate gover-
nance frameworks. The Green Deal with the ambition 
to achieve zero net emissions of greenhouse gases by 
2050 is set to unleash a torrent of new climate and 
energy legislation61. In the digital field, beyond the ICT 
Standardisation Priorities for the Digital Single Market62, 
the EU digital strategy63, the strategy for data64 and the 
White Paper on AI65 recognise the importance to adopt 
standards for the new generation of technology, and a 
strategy for standardisation has been announced66.
11
The EU’s rules-based and multi-level gover-
nance model
The EU is in a unique position to influence and 
further develop rules-based international co-
operation with like-minded countries. The EU still 
holds an important role as an agenda-setter for new 
international norms and standards. The EU is increas-
ing its profile as a global change leader on climate and 
green transitions, and as a gatekeeper on environmen-
tal and labour standards, as well as data governance 
and privacy. This will require the EU to work in close 
partnership with other global players and internation-
al institutions, and with like-minded countries67. The EU 
can call on its vast reserves of diplomacy, expertise in 
legislative, institutional and political reform, Research 
& Innovation (R&I) and scientific excellence as well as 
experience in consensus-building among EU27. Recent 
events have demonstrated that the EU has the oppor-
tunity to leverage its strengths, assets, confidence and 
political and public will to advance a responsible global 
change agenda.
A forward-looking rationale for the EU’s open 
strategic autonomy is to reinvigorate multilat-
eral and rules-based cooperation. This form of co-
operation must have the foundation of effective and 
representative international institutions. The EU is best-
placed to take on the role of responsible agenda-setter 
of international norms and standards, serve as live lab-
oratory of multilateral based cooperation and multi-lev-
el governance, and be a powerful driver of responsible 
global change. By taking on this mission and multiple 
roles, the EU will be serving the global community and 
advancing progress on much needed global reforms 
and transitions. At the same, the EU will also be serving 
open strategic autonomy concerns and interests by de-
veloping an effective mechanism for exporting carefully 
constructed, economically and socially just policies, and 
European values, internationally.
Future opportunities and challenges
Changes ahead are expected to present Europe 
with three key clusters of geopolitical challenges. 
First, significant change is foreseen on the geopolitical 
front with an increasing redistribution of global pow-
er. Major shifts are expected towards a more multipolar 
and contested international order, as well as the emer-
gence and positioning of global powers, particularly in 
the East. The energy transition will further contribute to the redistribution of power globally. In addition, in-
creased competition in standardisation will also contrib-
ute to the ways in which nations and regions will posi-
tion themselves globally. The second key cluster relates 
to global rivalry and fragility that are likely to increase. 
These include tensions in European neighbouring re-
gions, in the Western Balkans and MENA. At a global 
level, the US-China rivalry could define the geopolitical 
landscape in the near future. This could be aggravat-
ed by China’s expanding influence worldwide. Moreover, 
Africa could have its existing fragilities expanded, to a 
point of being unable to reduce its overall poverty, thus 
threatening global sustainability. The third key cluster 
(of geopolitical challenges) is related to the multitude 
of threats the EU could face in respect to its global po-
sition. In addition, increasing hybrid warfare by Russia 
could potentially threaten the EU’s security and its en-
ergy landscape.
These challenges present Europe with underlying 
opportunities. For instance, the evolution of the US’s 
role globally could provide the EU with a like-minded 
ally on rules-based order and managing interdepen-
dence. Likewise, the EU can expand its influence and 
traction to advance partnerships in its neighbourhood 
and in MENA. Strengthening global alliances, establish-
ing networks and partnerships, and using international 
institutions with a focus on critical areas and issues in 
which the EU can exert most influence will be key for 
securing open strategic autonomy while fostering mul-

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDtilateral governance and cooperation. The EU could also 
exploit its strengths in setting global standards more 
broadly to safeguard and advance its interests, particu-
larly in advancing global green, digital and social transi-
tions. In addition, the EU has the opportunity to leverage 
its soft power and position in the global competition for 
standardisation by identifying critical areas and tech-
nologies for future standardisation. Most importantly, 
currently the EU is in a good position to advance its de-
fence and security capacity by building a shared vision 
and set of priorities, as well as establishing coordinated 
actions amongst Member States.
Increasingly multipolar and contested evolu-
tion of the international order 
Multi-dimensional competition and deep interde-
pendence are likely to be the two defining fea-
tures of the international system over the long-
term. This is based on current evolutions concerning the 
redistribution of power, the digital transformation and 
climate change. In this context, there seems to be three 
possible ways forward concerning the evolution of the 
international order:
1. The various forms of multipolarity will undermine 
rules-based cooperation, with nationalism on the 
rise, mutual trust among major powers undermined, 
international institutions side-lined, and globalisa-tion splintering. In the absence of the will or ca-
pacity of a liberal hegemonic power, like the US, to 
preserve order, there is the potential for ‘the jungle 
to grow back’68, although recent commitments from 
both NATO’s69 and the G7’s70 representatives point to-
wards increased unity and coordination among allies. 
2. The progressive emergence of two distinct (political, 
security and technology) orders, centred on the US 
and China, with a relatively thin layer of common 
norms, which allows for a degree of economic ex-
change and cooperation on shared challenges, such 
as climate change71.
3. Major powers will need to both compete and coop-
erate on different issues, because they face both 
the ‘problems of anarchy’ (such as hegemonic 
struggles or spheres of influence) and the ‘problems 
of modernity’ (the impact of science, technologies, 
climate change and trans-national challenges)72. 
From this standpoint, the rules-based order would 
not necessarily fall down, rather it would (arguably) 
just become more fragmented – a trend that is al-
ready at play. A variety of non-mutually exclusive 
formats for cooperation could operate, including: 
• Coalitions of like-minded countries (such as lib-
eral democracies); Figure 4: Top 20 revenue generators

• Larger and more inclusive multilateral struc-
tures dealing with shared challenges like the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
the climate crises, or health; and
• A vast range of formats and networks, includ-
ing non-state (including firms) and sub-state 
actors, such as cities, providing the fabric for in-
ternational cooperation, for example on issues 
of sustainable development and connectivity. 
It is important to highlight that the interplay 
between state and corporate powers largely 
shape international relations74. Figure 4 shows 
the states or companies that occupy the top 
rankings, with the US first, followed by China 
and Japan (the Eurozone ranks first with more 
than EUR4,687 billion if treated as a single po-
litical entity)75. In combination with the increas-
ing nationalist and protectionist backlash in 
large parts of the world, this could lead to a re-
vival of global rivalries with states using corpo-
rations to help achieve geopolitical goals in an 
increasingly hostile environment, and powerful 
corporations using strategies that are more ag-
gressive to extract profits in response76.
China’s expanding influence worldwide
The EU has developed international partnerships 
for geopolitical purposes, but is falling behind 
China recently regarding its global position. The 
EU uses its development role to support less advanced 
countries worldwide, to secure its global position and 
promote its values and the rule of law together with 
poverty reduction and sustainable development. Howev-
er, the EU has gradually been losing the limelight in this 
role with China’s launch and expansion in 2014 of the 
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which combines econom-
ic and development cooperation with geopolitical and 
geostrategic security goals. “China increasingly sees its 
flagship foreign policy project as a tool for restructuring 
global governance and a vector for promoting a new 
form of globalisation”77.
China is using the Belt and Road Initiative to en-
hance its influence worldwide, including its mili-
tary and security presence. China has set up ‘stra-
tegic bases’ of military and/or security interest in Africa 
and installed intelligence surveillance technologies and 
capacities, including facial recognition technologies78. 
This, combined with other tactics, including debt entrap-
ment, is jeopardising not only the autonomy of the Af-rican countries concerned, but it is also influencing the 
EU’s autonomy and value system. For example, there 
is concern that by exporting surveillance technologies, 
China is exporting more than just the technologies, and 
is providing African governments the means to use 
these against political opponents and activists, going 
against EU democratic ideals. This highlights the poten-
tial threat of ‘digital or algorithmic colonialism’ based 
on foreign-developed AI, integrated in mass products 
used by Africans79. However, the BRI goes beyond Africa 
and to specific sectors such as infrastructure, space and 
digital. It also encompasses Latin America, the South 
Pacific and the Arctic, with all countries being potentially 
impacted by it. Moreover, beyond the economic sectors 
that are a potential target of the BRI, it goes further to 
include global governance and non-material dimensions 
in its underlying strategy80.
China is relocating production to Africa. China-Af-
rica trade has grown about 20 fold in the last two de-
cades. There are signals that it is set to grow further, 
as China makes plans to further increase its foothold. 
With labour intensive industry in China losing competi-
tiveness through rising labour costs, an option for them 
could be to relocate production to African countries. 
Ethiopia started an ambitious ‘industrial parks pro-
gramme’ to attract investors in the light manufacturing 
industry. However, the competitive advantage of wage 
level offered by Africa is similar to some Southeast 
Asian countries81. 
China’s influence in Africa is growing82. Chinese 
firms are turning to African technology ventures and 
ambitious China-Africa joint cooperation projects on 
ocean science, green agriculture, energy technology 
cooperation and geo-science cooperation, which are 
signals of investing in joint expertise83. However, China 
might become an obstacle to African industrialisation, 
as China dominates the sectors in which newly industri-
alised economies, like African ones, might want to enter 
with tremendous advantages of scale84.
China’s influence in Africa extends to security af-
fairs, which increases concerns globally due to 
trade becoming both a product and a tool of se-
curity policies. At the political level, besides the regu-
lar meetings of the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation 
(FOCAC) established in 2000, recent initiatives point to 
a growing focus on security affairs. This illustrates that 
China is “weaponising trade and investments strategies 
as instruments of geopolitics”85. At the same time the 
14
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND“geopoliticisation of European trade and investment poli-
cy” has emerged more prominently. These developments 
characterise “the external face of economic statecraft  
whereby trade policies come to be embedded in power ri-
valries”, thus being “a policy space where geo-economics 
is both a product and a tool of security policies”86.
China’s global influence goes beyond the Belt and 
Road Initiative, including hybrid threats. Current-
ly, the dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region have given 
rise to intense geopolitical competition87, adding to in-
creasing pressure on trade and supply chains, as well 
as in tensions in technological, political and security 
areas. Across the Indo-Pacific, China has more eco-
nomic influence, whereas the US has more diplomatic 
and military weight. However, economic development 
is valued above security concerns and with this China 
sees an opportunity to expand its power by fostering 
regional integration and dependence, limiting the role 
of outside powers, and bringing Southeast Asia under 
its leadership88. Beyond a strategy for the Indo-Pacific 
region89, the EU will need to build alliances90 in order to 
contribute to stability and prosperity in the region. Fi-
nally, China’s tactics near the South China Sea illustrate 
new confrontational strategies at sea, with attempts at 
creating a de facto exclusive maritime zone through the 
use of non-military hybrid tactics91. 
Shifting economic power from North to East
Economic power is shifting from the US and the 
EU (North) to China and India (East). Shifts in global 
economic power are expected to complement the geo-
political power shifts as US-China relations evolve. Chi-
na and India are expected to become the two largest 
economies by 205092. 
Current trends indicate that the EU will continue 
to lose its economic standing. Europe’s ambition to 
take global leadership in green and digital transitions 
could position it strongly in an emerging lucrative mar-
ket. However, it is not clear if this will suffice to stop 
the declining economic trend overall. Thirty years ago 
the EU accounted for 25% of the world’s wealth, which 
is projected to go down to 11% by 2040 compared to 
China (22%) and the US (14%)93 by 2040.
The global landscape will evolve with develop-
ing countries shifting from being ‘policy takers’ 
to ‘policy shapers’ at international level. The E7 
countries (China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Turkey) are projected to account for 41% of GDP by 
2040 and to reduce poverty, thus exerting more influ-
ence on global economic institutions and rule-setting94. 
A key decider will be the combination of alliances, (eco-
nomic, technological and geopolitical), which are like-
ly to emerge within G7 and E7 countries and between 
them. New geo-economic political alliances are likely to 
give rise to other new alliances in response to efforts to 
build global economic power.
Widening redistribution of power due to the 
energy transition
Demand for coal, oil and gas is expected to dras-
tically drop between today and 2050. This will pro-
gressively decrease prices and lead to a considerable 
redistribution of economic wealth and power. With a 
global fossil fuel import bill standing at about EUR 1.6 
trillion in 201595, importers will benefit from a reduction 
in energy import costs. For example, reaching climate 
neutrality is expected to reduce the EU’s energy import 
dependence from 54% in 2018 to 20% in 205096, 97. On 
the other hand, fossil fuel exporters will lose a large 
source of both revenue and influence. Among the ex-
porters, those with the least diversified economies and/
or the weakest governance frameworks, such as various 
countries in the MENA region98 and Africa, stand to be 
the most affected. Some Gulf producers like Saudi Ara-
bia and United Arab Emirates may be less drastically 
impacted than others, given their large financial means, 
and ongoing or envisaged efforts to diversify their econ-
omies99 by focusing on an innovation strategy within a 
number of sectors100. 
Three categories of countries will gain influence 
from the energy transition. These include those 
countries with a large capacity to generate and export 
renewable power, those endowed with the minerals that 
are necessary for green technologies, and those lead-
ing technological innovation in renewable energy101. The 
concentration of the supply of some of the raw mate-
rials central to enabling the green transition has raised 
concerns about new import dependencies. Deliberate 
political decisions by exporters, conflict or instability in 
the countries or areas where resources are extracted, 
natural disasters or pandemics are some of the poten-
tial sources of supply chain disruption. Technological 
innovation that enables material substitution could de-
crease import reliance in the future. 
15Increasing global competition in standardisation
China and the EU are increasingly challenging 
the US leadership in standardisation. Standardi-
sation has historically served as a key lever in state 
rivalry for economic and trade dominance103. China is 
laying out their China Standards 2035 plan to define 
the next generation of technologies that they could 
roll out through the 140 countries along the Belt and 
Road Initiative104. The EU is challenging standards on 
cars, chemicals, food and data privacy. In the digital 
age, all three powers are battling to gain ‘first mov-
er’ advantage in standard setting, thereby benefiting 
their own companies, businesses and technologies, 
and shaping the global digital economy105.  
The rules and standards the EU sets in the single 
market are the basis for global standards, under-
pinning the EU’s global regulatory power. To fur-
ther increase the EU’s standardisation power and use it 
as an opportunity to seize future benefits, it is import-
ant to identify critical technologies and other relevant 
areas where Europe could get a competitive advan-
tage by being first in setting future standards. This is 
key to gain first mover advantage against the US and 
China, and thereby benefit EU’s companies, businesses 
and technologies. Key sectors might include those of 
the green and digital transitions, including transport, 
construction and energy106.Emerging US-China rivalry
The US-China rivalry is likely to become a defining 
feature of the international landscape. The shape 
it will evolve into is still unclear. Strictly speaking, this 
presupposes the progressive emergence of two blocs 
opposing each other across the board, including with 
regards to political/ideological, economic, technological, 
and security dimensions. From this standpoint, a new 
Cold war may be even more dangerous than the previ-
ous one, given the potential impact of cyber-capabilities 
and threats on the balance of power. 
The US-China relationship could amount to some 
form of ‘cooperative rivalry’ in the near future. 
In other words, a relationship that manages competi-
tion to avert conflict107. Despite a lot of technological 
decoupling, the economies of the US and China will re-
main too interconnected to split. In addition, it is unclear 
whether the US and China will be prepared to accept 
the costs and risks of all-out confrontation, as opposed 
to advancing their relative position through a mix of 
more assertive and more accommodating measures. In 
this case, trans-national challenges, including climate 
change, pandemics and weapons of mass destruction 
proliferation, will feature higher on the international 
agenda, thus threatening both the US and China, and 
requiring at least some degree of cooperation among 
them.Figure 5 Development of US and Chinese economies 2005 to 2035, GDP in billion US dollar (constant

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDOpen Strategic Autonomy is chiefly about Eu-
rope’s ability to set its own priorities and course 
of action. As China’s power grows, the debate may 
intensify within Europe concerning the correlation be-
tween advancing open strategic autonomy and shap-
ing a common transatlantic agenda in the face of the 
new superpower (Figures 5 and 6). There is of course, 
no guarantee that these projections will be realised, and 
also that economic power does not directly convert into 
other dimensions of power. However, within a couple of 
decades the power differential between China and the 
EU may be considerable. 
This ongoing power shift to the East will affect the 
position and role of the US in unpredictable ways. 
Linear projections concerning the respective power as-sets of the US and China are subject to discontinuities 
(from technological breakthroughs to pandemics) and 
to the impact of political choices. The ways in which re-
sources are used (unilaterally or multilaterally, through 
coercion or persuasion) is at least as important as the 
amount of available assets109. Equally relevant is the 
difference between potential power (power that is avail-
able) and usable power (power that can actually be 
wielded)110. Internal and external constraints are going 
to affect US foreign policy and its margin of manoeuvre 
to a larger extent than they have in the past. 
The ways in which the US will define and pursue 
its core interests in a multipolar and contested 
environment remains uncertain. Critical variables in 
the medium to long-term include: the US’s ability to re-Figure 6 Shift on global share of GDP of major powers 2019, 2040 and 2050 (based on GDP at current

17main at the forefront of technological innovation, the 
pace and quality of economic growth (including conse-
quences for the middle class), the implications of the 
fast-raising public debt (including for the defence bud-
gets and military engagements worldwide), prospects 
for domestic political polarisation and its impact on US 
foreign policy, and the evolution of the power of others, 
notably China, relative to that of the US.
Three potential evolutions of the US’s global role 
are possible. These different alternatives, and relat-
ed developments, will chart different plausible (and 
non-mutually exclusive) courses for the future of US 
foreign policy.
1. The first is a reaffirmation of the US’s global leader-
ship following its orchestration of the response to the 
challenges posed by China. From this standpoint, US 
global engagement is essential to support the liberal 
international order, which should be a core interest 
of the US. The US has the power to exert global lead-
ership and that includes working closely with allies 
and like-minded partners, which multiplies America’s 
influence111. Recent developments at the G7112 and 
NATO113 summits point in this direction.
2. The second possible development in the medium- 
to long-term is a level of retrenchment. The costs 
of US military over-reach and involvement in un-
stable regions and countries outweigh the benefits 
and the US should focus on other core threats and 
challenges, including the rise of China, reduce its 
commitments abroad and rely on its allies to carry 
more of the military and defence burden114. 
3. The third possibility is that of a recalibration of the US 
global position. Some argue that the US should move 
beyond the dichotomy of restoration and retrench-
ment and think about different ways of projecting its 
leadership, including a focus on domestic renewal, an 
emphasis on working with allies and others, and giving 
more attention to large transnational challenges115. 
Various elements of continuity can be detected 
in the evolution of US foreign policy over the last 
decade. These appear relevant to the decade to come 
as well, and beyond. These consist of a more delimited 
definition of core US national interests, with a growing 
focus on the domestic political and economic implica-
tions of foreign and trade policy decisions and a reluc-
tance to intervene militarily in regional crises that do not pose a direct threat to the US. It emphasises that allies 
take a much bigger share of the burden for their own 
security, as well as a shift in strategic priorities towards 
dealing with the challenges posed by a rising China.
Growing fragility of Africa and geopolitical ri-
valry in MENA116
Africa faces a major challenge to convert long-
term demographic growth prospects into a posi-
tive factor of economic growth and development. 
Africa’s population is projected to expand from 1.2 bil-
lion to 1.8 billion between 2017 and 2035 - at which 
time about half of the population would be under the 
age of 21. Based on pre-pandemic development pat-
terns, and in the absence of major investments in hu-
man capital and infrastructures, demographic growth 
would likely compound poverty. By this estimate, the 
number of those living in extreme poverty in Africa 
would grow by 170m between 2016 and 2035, even 
though by then they would represent a smaller share of 
the overall population117.
The pandemic could undo several years of develop-
ment progress in Africa118. The prospect of successive 
waves of infections - due to a late rollout of vaccina-
tions – threatens Africa’s recovery from the pandemic119. 
Depending on different projections, the African economy 
could be between EUR 288 billion and EUR 531 billion 
smaller by 2030, compared to pre-pandemic forecasts, 
and an additional 38 to 75 million people may fall into 
extreme poverty in the next ten years. Economic recession 
followed by sluggish growth, would drastically reduce the 
fiscal space (i.e. flexibility of government spending) of Af-
rican countries, including their capacity to deliver basic 
public services such as health. On average, African gov-
ernments are already spending 30% of their revenues on 
servicing debt (up from 20% before the pandemic) and 
debt payments are expected to pose a major challenge 
in coming years120. Based on these forecasts, Africa will 
drift even further away from fulfilling most of the 2030 
Sustainable Development Goals. 
The Covid-19 pandemic threatens the positive 
transformations of the African continent to date. 
Africa seemed to be embarking on a decade of unprec-
edented economic growth, sustained by the creation of 
the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), wide-
spread diffusion of technological innovation, hopes of 
democratic transitions, and the continent’s new prom-
inence in global geopolitics. African countries were 
18
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDprogressing towards increased regional cooperation, 
social inclusion and governance capacity. The EU and 
the African Union (AU) were moving steadily towards 
the definition of a new joint strategy. However, with the 
pandemic, violence and conflicts have increased, prog-
ress in trade integration has been threatened due to 
border measures and travel restrictions, and democrati-
sation and the rule of law has been jeopardised in some 
countries. This indicates that Africa has entered its first 
recession in 25 years121. Looking forward, the evolution 
of Africa in the post-COVID-19 world will depend on the 
strategic assertiveness of African countries and their 
capacity to translate this into a collective African voice 
shaping global order122.
Africa has various global players exerting eco-
nomic or political influence and creating new pat-
terns of multipolar competition123. The EU is likely 
to face adverse competition on a number of economic 
and geopolitical fronts. It can also embrace opportuni-
ties for enriched international cooperation with Africa, 
reinforcing multilateralism and shaping a more sustain-
able future. In spite of having common denominators 
among EU Member States on Africa, its growing impor-
tance for many individual Member States could amplify 
intra-EU competition. This could further undermine the 
EU’s credibility and effectiveness in the African conti-
nent in relation to other global actors, beyond reducing 
the EU’s overall ground in the continent due to the lack 
of a coordinated approach. The potential for the EU to 
lose momentum could be exacerbated, because grow-
ing multipolar competition in the region enables African 
countries to choose their best allies and most profitable 
deals. At the same time, these can fuel anti-Western 
rhetoric in a battle of strategic narratives and potential 
regime changes, especially by Russia, Turkey and Chi-
na. Furthermore, Russia is moving as one of the fastest 
growing trade partners for sub-Saharan Africa, since 
both have an alignment of strategic narratives. Russia is 
delivering ‘political technology’ services, economic ben-
efits, and relatively cheap arms. The lack of normative 
conditionality, the presence of Russian-supported disin-
formation networks and the expansion of quasi-private 
military companies, risks undermining EU interests, ob-
jectives and values in the African region124.
Africa’s growing fragilities and challenges ahead 
are manifold125. Climate change and increased pres-
sure on resources could hinder cooperation and integra-
tion of African countries, and impact food production, 
infrastructure, trade and livelihoods. Digital inequalities persist. A slow adoption of cyber regulation and the ab-
sence of a joint marketplace may lead to catastrophic 
economic consequences. Increasing conflicts, armed vi-
olence and organised crime, may lead to increased in-
security as well as undermining the implementation and 
gains of the AfCTA. Reduced economic growth is leading 
to an increasing inability for Africa to reduce the size 
of its informal sector (i.e. the black market) and its un-
employment, as well as to generate new jobs. Increas-
ing urbanisation coupled with a lack of urban planning 
and industrial development risks the fragmentation of 
urban centres and the rise of dysfunctional cities that 
may become hotbeds of protests, riots and conflicts. De-
creased integration may undermine the delivery of pub-
lic services, thus jeopardising human development and 
growth. Diminished rates of electrification may erode 
universal access to energy and affect various sectors. 
The increased wealth of a few among the population 
could potentially lead to militarisation. The inability to 
capitalise upon the potential of Africa’s maritime do-
main could exacerbate threats to the continent’s secu-
rity and prosperity. However, if appropriately addressed, 
these challenges could be turned into opportunities to 
sustain a free trade area, have improved security, meet 
sustainability needs, or act as enablers for growth.
External powers are increasingly becoming a key 
factor in shaping the future of the Middle East 
and the North Africa (MENA) region. In a multipo-
lar landscape, regional powers such as the Gulf coun-
tries, or Egypt, can be expected to hedge their bets. 
While game-changing events cannot be ruled out, 
current trends point to the US engaging in the MENA 
more selectively, retreating from the role of ultimate 
arbiter of regional geopolitics, while prioritising vital in-
terests, such as preventing a nuclear arms race. Russia 
has been highly effective in projecting its influence in 
the region in recent years, dictated mainly by economic 
and diplomatic mandates, as well as political-military 
opportunities126. It can be expected to remain an im-
portant player in certain geographical areas, such as 
the Eastern Mediterranean, but its resources are limited 
to sustaining its geopolitical ambitions. It is likely that 
China will continue to expand its diplomatic, political 
and economic footprint in the MENA region, though it 
is not clear to what extent it will become more involved 
in managing conflicts and crises there. China is already 
the largest individual investor in the region. Its trade 
with the Middle East was 16 times larger in 2018 than 
in 2000. Approximately 40% of China’s oil imports come 
19
from the region, and China is expected to play a major 
role in the MENA’s digital and energy transitions, provid-
ing infrastructure and technology127. 
Impacts of COVID-19 could de-stabilise the MENA 
region. This could increase domestic friction in MENA coun-
tries as poverty grows, living conditions deteriorate and so-
cieties see little capacity and/or willingness by governments 
to introduce much-needed reforms. The region could then 
become highly dependent on external influences.
The EU has an opportunity to exert considerable 
influence and traction to advance partnerships in 
MENA. The EU’s current influence in MENA is weak, with 
implications ranging from displacement to extremism 
and terrorism. Nevertheless, the EU has the potential 
to exert greater influence in the region by acting in a 
more coordinated manner and focusing its efforts on 
specific areas. These include supporting security and de-
ploying military presence in the region where necessary 
(i.e. decoupling from US leadership), expanding its diplo-
matic influence (i.e. providing mediation, reconstruction 
assistance and support to the development of account-
able institutions), as well as leveraging economic (i.e. 
trade and aid) and political influence (i.e. EU assertive 
coalitions in partnership with the European External Ac-
tion Service (EEAS) and coherent policy positions) con-
currently128. Ultimately, the EU has the opportunity to 
balance its current focus on migration and counter-ter-
rorism with steps towards lasting regional stability, by 
reinforcing sustainable governance systems, thereby 
using the economic and political assets at its dispos-
al. The EU can advance its influence further through in-
ternational and global institutions. Other opportunities 
include advancing responsible global changes, such as 
achieving the SDGs. To do so the EU will need to build 
worldwide alliances and use international institutions, 
establish networks and partnerships, and focus on criti-
cal areas where it can exert the most influence. 
Increasing geopolitical rivalry in the Western 
Balkans 
The Western Balkans countries are exposed to 
growing geopolitical competition in the region129. 
Despite being at the heart of Europe, Russia has been 
pursuing a strategy of influence as part of its wider 
competition with the West130, and China has increased 
its economic presence there, while also developing oth-
er vectors of long-term engagement131. In this context, 
the evolution of the accession process to the EU will be 
a fundamental variable for the future of the region132. Despite some recent positive steps, a sense of fatigue 
has affected mutual perceptions in recent years, amid 
stagnating reforms. Among other initiatives, spurring 
substantial economic investment and better integration 
of the region in the EU’s supply chains would improve 
economic prospects and promote intra-regional cooper-
ation. Similar would be to devise the necessary means 
to effectively support a green agenda and energy tran-
sition in the Western Balkans, spreading EU norms in 
the Energy Community, and helping the region becom-
ing less dependent on Russian gas133.
Broadening projection of hybrid warfare by Russia
Russia is likely to continue to project its influ-
ence in Europe. Competition between Russia and the 
EU/NATO is very unlikely to subside in the near future, 
since that would require substantial shifts in the foreign 
policy priorities of both sides. In this context, Russia’s 
influence in Eastern Europe, the Baltics and across the 
whole of Europe could take place by leveraging econom-
ic and energy relations, mobilising links with local polit-
ical and economic actors and using the full toolbox of 
hybrid warfare (i.e. a combination of conventional and 
unconventional tools of warfare)134. Russia could con-
tinue to increase polarisation, deterring trust in democ-
racy through disinformation and support for extremist 
movements135, 136. Moreover, Russia is likely to attempt 
to shape the digital revolution to reinforce its author-
itarian political system, as well as to use its military 
engagement abroad as part of its strategy to assert its 
great power status claim137.
The Eastern Partnership includes an increasing-
ly heterogeneous group of countries138. They cover 
the EU Member States and post-Soviet states of Arme-
nia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. 
Whether their trajectories will converge or diverge over 
the long-term will depend on their domestic develop-
ments and on the balance of influence between Russia 
and the EU/NATO139. From this standpoint, the severe 
challenges facing Russia’s economic growth could be 
an important variable. Russia may become a less rele-
vant economic partner for some countries in the shared 
neighbourhood, whether in terms of trade or remittanc-
es. Several factors may re-define the regional energy 
landscape and progressively lower dependency on Rus-
sia in the long-term. These include alternative supply 
routes from the Caspian Sea through the Caucasus to 
Europe, the development of interconnectors between EU 
Member States and Eastern neighbours, the availability

newable energy.
Increasing threats to the EU global positioning 
Space is a priority area for open strategic au-
tonomy. Europe has scored remarkable achievements, 
such as the Galileo and Copernicus Space Programmes. 
Currently, space is used for countless civil and military 
applications and it is an increasingly contested and con-
gested political and in the technological arena140. It is a 
domain of growing international economic and security 
competition, with the US, China and Russia carrying out 
major investments for both national security concerns 
and economic competitiveness141. The combination of 
cheaper commercial launchers and the rise of private 
companies with an interest in space, earth-based tech-
nological shifts (such as 5G and 6G), and the rise of new 
space powers (such as China, India and the United Arab 
Emirates) gives EU Member States reason to consider 
beyond economics, to the geopolitical importance of 
space142. Moreover, the ‘weaponisation’ of space by EU 
rivals is a trend that is increasingly supported by new 
technologies such as Anti-Satellite Weapons. Therefore, 
maintaining a sustainable presence in the space race 
is key for Europe, as this has consequences for the fu-
ture of the EU’s communications, Earth observation and 
manufacturing143, as well as security. 
Space weaponisation, congestion and disruption 
are the three interconnected geopolitical trends 
that should concern the EU144. A coherent strategic 
EU space approach is still needed145. Dependency on for-
eign technology and infrastructures in this domain would 
hamper technological sovereignty, undermine economic 
competitiveness and prevent the EU from acquiring a 
stronger degree of open strategic autonomy in security 
and defence issues. Electronic warfare and cyber threats 
challenge the functioning of EU space capacities, as ev-
idenced by the increasing use of anti-satellite weapons 
(i.e. space-to-space and ground-to-space)146. Hence, a re-
newed investment is required through adequate financial 
means, focusing on key areas of technological innovation 
and dealing with geopolitical competition in space147.
The EU’s forthcoming Strategic Compass148 on 
security and defence is an opportunity to better 
link space and defence, to the evolving EU’s space 
strategy. The Permanent Structured Cooperation and 
the European Defence Fund are already being mobilised 
to finance and develop space capabilities for EU secu-
rity and defence. Existing tools such as Copernicus and Galileo Space Programmes are also being used for a 
range of security-related tasks such as search and res-
cue, border management, and even Common Security 
and Defence Policy missions and operations. The new 
EU Space Programme149 worth €13.2 billion will sup-
port the European launcher industry to promote new 
propulsion technologies and it will use the new CASSINI 
initiative to invest €1 billion in space start-ups and in-
novation, beyond giving the EU autonomy over space 
tracking technology standards. In order to capitalise on 
these steps forward, it remains a priority to better link 
space and defence, as well as to ensure political coor-
dination to meet the threats of the next 5-10 years150.
The military capacity of various actors is grow-
ing151. This contributes to further instability at glob-
al level and further threatens the multilateral system 
that is already under pressure. Zones of instability and 
conflict in different regions close to the EU and beyond 
is likely to persist, and may even grow in the coming 
decade. This will contribute to further deterioration of 
multilateralism due increased fragilities of some states, 
inter-state tensions, and action of non-state actors that 
are likely to strengthen their hybrid tools, including dis-
ruptive technologies, information operations and both 
military (e.g. terrorism) and non-military influence.
Cyberspace is developing as a contested domain 
in which malicious activities constitute a threat 
to the EU152. The EU has an interest in ensuring a free, 
open, secure and stable cyberspace. Beyond terrorism 
and criminal networks, the internet is increasingly used 
for national security purposes by both state and non-
state actors. Cyber-attacks are complex to apprehend, 
anticipate and react to, and they are difficult to attribute 
to any responsible person or group. The growing frag-
mentation and state control of cyberspace is undermin-
ing democracy, freedom, the multilateral rules-based 
order and multi-stakeholder governance of the internet. 
Cyberspace is also characterised by a concentration of 
private actors that manage cyber platforms and con-
centrate large amounts of personal data. In a variety of 
ways, the developments in cyberspace are shaping the 
geopolitical context.
Three trends depict the changes in the security 
domain triggered by the cyber realm153. First, an in-
crease in the disruptive use of AI displays the ways in 
which the cyber realm has created new tools for disrup-
tive use, where cyberattacks supported by AI are likely 
to emerge against critical infrastructure. Second, the ex-
21
pansion of the role of cyber during times of crisis lead-
ing to unexpected events and cascading effects, such as 
happened during COVID-19 with disinformation inciting 
attacks against infrastructure. Third, a growth in depen-
dency between policy and technology shows the ways in 
which cyber has affected the relationship between the 
public and the private sector, with a renewed require-
ment for dialogue between policy and technology firms 
to avoid an erosion the basic principles of democratic 
principles and liberal economies. 
The Arctic is increasingly becoming an area of 
geopolitical importance. A number of players see 
new strategic and economic opportunities in the region. 
The US is ramping up its presence in the Arctic as is Rus-
sia on its own Arctic provinces, and China’s Arctic inter-
ests are also growing. With the update of the EU’s cur-
rent Arctic policy, the EU is readying itself for the reins 
of power with a more precise and efficient approach. 
Such renewal of interest needs to respond to two ma-
jor changes that affect the region and pose challenges 
to the role of the EU in the Arctic: accelerated climate 
change and increased geoeconomic and geopolitical 
competition154. It is the fastest warming region on earth. 
Climate change is accelerating the melting of polar ice 
with larger chunks of the Arctic becoming accessible 
both in terms of access to untapped natural resources 
and to maritime routes. Also, competition for the Arctic 
between the US, Russia and China are exposing the re-
gion to ‘spill-over’ effects from competition in Europe 
and the Indo-Pacific155. These are accentuated by the 
erosion of the rules-based international order and the 
advancement of military capabilities in the region, es-
pecially from Russia156. 
The Arctic will be a strategic stress test for EU 
defence and for the transatlantic partnership. Chi-
na is expanding its economic, research and maritime 
presence in the Arctic. Chinese participation in Russian 
Arctic military exercises has increased global concern. 
Sino-Russian cooperation is largely energy and commer-
cially driven at present, but could extend to military co-
operation, which would be detrimental to European and 
transatlantic interests. European Arctic countries and 
the EU should strengthen multilateral cooperation, par-
ticularly through the Arctic Council. Ultimately, strategic 
rivalry will subject European defence and the transatlan-
tic partnership to an Arctic stress test, including a role 
for NATO in the region 157. Action and policy renewal are 
therefore key for Europe’s future access to fish, minerals (including rare earths), oil, gas and trade routes in the 
Arctic, as well as to increase influence in the region and 
to do its part to improve life (for indigenous people) and 
to combat climate change in the region. 
The Sino-Russian normative partnership poses 
three key challenges for the EU158. First, it contests 
the liberal foundations of current multilateral institu-
tions, aiming to redefine and re-interpret internation-
al norms to reflect shared principles, worldviews and 
threat perceptions. Second, both countries often violate 
existing international norms, even those they promote, 
based on the shared conviction that the international 
order is dominated by the US and the West, thus re-
flecting values that cannot be considered universal. 
Third, they challenge the EU and its values via propa-
ganda, disinformation and manipulation. Both countries 
seek state sovereignty through international joint per-
ceptions on human rights, international security norms 
and measures, and cyber-governance, which extends 
their cooperation in the political, economic and security 
realms. China is already working with Russia to fill gaps 
in its military capabilities, accelerate its technological 
innovation and complement its efforts to undermine the 
US and West leadership159. The mutual benefits their 
actions will generate is likely to amplify their global in-
fluence and have an impact on defence, democracy and 
human rights160.
Against this backdrop of diverse threats to the 
EU global position, a shared EU vision is key to 
advancing the EU’s open strategic autonomy. A 
strategic approach to positioning the EU in the world en-
tails building coordination and cohesion within the EU, 
as well as the convergence of Member States around 
a shared security and geopolitical vision. A subsequent 
step is an agreed set of priorities shared by all stake-
holders. Strengthening the EU’s resilience and ensuring 
its access to global commons requires investments in 
maritime, space and cyber, including civil-military exer-
cises, protecting maritime infrastructure161, and building 
further capacities in line with such a shared vision. Re-
inforcing Europe’s ability to build strategic alliances is 
also critical to addressing threats to the EU’s geopoliti-
cal positioning and space infrastructure162, as well as to 
deter un-attributable attacks, which are the hallmark of 
hybrid warfare163. Finally, such a vision is key for the EU 
to invest in strategic alliances on security and defence 
and being clear on what it wants to achieve with specific 
partners164.

Technology
Technological sovereignty is at the heart of the EU’s debate on open strategic autonomy. The notion 
of ‘technological sovereignty’ has emerged as a means of promoting the notion of European leadership and 
open strategic autonomy in the digital field. It is mostly oriented towards R&I and the development of digital 
technologies with the goal to be at the forefront. In this context, ‘digital sovereignty’ refers to the EU’s ability 
to act independently in the digital world and being conducive to foster digital innovation.  In this very dynamic 
field, current strengths and weaknesses overlap with future opportunities and challenges. This section provides 
a short summary of the EU’s strengths, weaknesses, challenges and opportunities infographic below and then 
discusses each of them in detail.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDCurrent strengths and weaknesses
Digital Race and Investment in Research and 
Innovation
The EU has been traditionally strong in in-
dustrial research and development (R&D). 
The investment in technological R&D in the EU has 
been increasing for 10 years consecutively165. EU 
companies increased R&D by 5.6% in 2019. This 
growth is driven by the automobile, ICT and health 
sectors. Two EU economies (Germany and France) 
were among the top five R&D performers within 
OECD countries in 2019. While the EU has strong 
capacities in research, the translation of research 
outputs into the economy and European industry 
need to be strengthened, to meet its goal of in-
creasing competitiveness. As detailed in the Euro-
pean Commission’s Industrial strategy, this could 
be achieved through Common Industrial Technolo-
gy Roadmaps. These roadmaps will link EU and na-
tional support programmes, allow for cutting-edge 
research and innovation, create synergies between 
research and industry and strengthen EU industrial 
ecosystems166.The EU has a strong tradition in quantum re-
search, which began with the creation of quan-
tum physics in the first decades of the twenti-
eth century. Current and future uses of quantum 
technology167 include building a functioning quantum 
computer, developing ultra-secure communication 
systems, or making major advances in quantum-sens-
ing technologies. Its market size is estimated to reach 
6 billion euro globally by 2027168. Currently, there is 
a global race to create and conquer the market of 
key quantum technologies of the future, led by the 
US, Japan and China. For example, the US is investing 
more than EUR 1 billion in the period 2019 – 2028 
and China is building a EUR 9 billion National Labo-
ratory for Quantum Information Sciences169. Figure 7 
gives an overview of the filled quantum computing 
patent applications in 2020. 
The European Commission has launched Quan-
tum Technologies Flagship Initiative. Its aim is to 
address some of the unsolvable research challenges 
so far (for example, developing ultra-secure commu-
nication systems or making major advances in quan-
tum sensing technologies) and create world-leading 
knowledge-based industry in Europe. This initiative, Figure 7. Leading 100 companies filling quantum computing patent applications in 2020

launched in 2018 provides more than €1 billion in 
funding for the technology to ensure its potential is 
fully exploited, with €152 million invested in the pe-
riod 2018-2021170. 
EU Member States are also investing separate-
ly in quantum computing171. For example, in June 
2021, Germany launched its first quantum com-
puter jointly produced by IBM and Fraunhofer Ge-
sellschaft172.
Quantum computing and its potential are attract-
ing top IT companies173. The US’s IBM and Microsoft  
lead in the number of patents related to hardware and 
software in quantum computing. Japanese Toshiba 
and Chinese Huawei, together with Chinese State Grid 
Corporation and Hengtong group lead in the number 
of patents in quantum communication and cryptogra-
phy.174 Through a coordinated effort between European 
research programs, the EU Member States and the pri-
vate sector, the EU aims to develop a so-called quantum 
web, where quantum computers, simulators and sen-
sors are interconnected via quantum communication 
networks with the goal to strengthen its technological 
sovereignty. 
European industries can increase their global 
technological leadership though public and pri-
vate investment in R&I. Private-public partnerships 
will be key for the future. While global corporate R&D 
continues to increase, many of the future R&I fund-
ing programmes for digital technologies will boost the 
green transformation and EU competitiveness. Syner-
gies between relevant EU programmes can also help 
EU achieve its technological sovereignty, as well as 
spin-offs and spin-ins. Scaling up and transition from 
research to industry (tech transfer) is key for the EU to 
benefit from long-term systematic investment in quan-
tum computing175.
EU companies show a diversified and strong 
technological and industrial base176. However, the 
EU should keep investing in R&D so that it does not 
lose ground towards its competitors. The global con-
centration of R&D performance continues to shift from 
the US and EU to China, followed by other South Asian 
and East-Southeast Asian states, which collectively ac-
counted for 42% of global R&D expenditures (up from 25% in 2000), higher than the United States (25%) 
and the EU (20%). With these regions continuing to 
record substantially faster-than-average R&D growth 
rates, this remaking of the global geography of R&D is 
unlikely to slow down soon177.
A sovereign EU Tech Fund has recently been pro-
posed. Leaders of 32 EU ‘unicorns’ (i.e. start-ups worth 
over $1 billion) proposed that the European Commis-
sion come up with new European Moonshots, focused 
on software and hardware start-ups, deep tech and 
green tech start-ups,178 and co-create flagships that 
will lead to the rise of a European innovation ecosys-
tem. This would further secure EU innovation and tech-
nological leadership on a global scale. They also pro-
posed a technological sovereignty fund worth EUR 100 
billion for the EU to keep pace with other countries in 
the digital race. The fund would be based on a long-
term, equity-based focus. 
Robotics and automation
The rapid increase in the use of robots in our 
homes and at work, in hospitals and industrial 
environments, shows that this technology is and 
will remain an important element of current and 
future European society. The robotics market is in-
creasingly driven by the development of novel and im-
proved products in areas such as manufacturing, search, 
rescue and retrieval, inspection and monitoring, surgery 
and healthcare, homes and cars, transport and logistics, 
agriculture, and many more179. Applications of robotics 
include health, ageing population, environment, security, 
service markets, ICT, automotive and other sectors with 
automated production. 
Europe is strong in the area of robotics. It holds 
a comparative advantage in comparison with other 
world regions. The EU produces “more than a quar-
ter of the world’s industrial and professional service 
robots (e.g. for precision farming, security, health, lo-
gistics)”180. The European robotics research excellence 
is the payback from the allocation of 700€ million for 
research up to 2020, through the Robotics Public Pri-
vate Partnership (SPARC, the partnership for robotics 
in EU), and further private investments that reach 2.8€ 
billion in total181.
26
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDEU setting rules and standards in digital 
technologies
Digital standardisation is key to leveraging the 
EU’s ability for leadership in digital technologies, 
or in the digital domain. This is important in order to 
shape the global digital economy and ensure the safety 
and reliability of AI systems for the future. In this area, 
US leadership is being increasingly challenged by China 
(in AI) and by the EU (data privacy).  
Governance, regulation and standardisation of 
digital technologies will be a critical factor to maxi-
mise digital opportunities, while reducing the challeng-
es or threats184 that they pose in parallel. This requires 
careful and innovative forms of regulation that do not 
stifle, but steer innovation. The EU needs to both gen-
erate innovation and frame technological applications 
in accordance with its economic and social model and 
its values. This is the foundation that will carry more 
weight in multilateral efforts to regulate new technol-
ogies. Through responsible governance, citizens’ rights 
and freedoms will be protected. The translation of 
values and norms into the design and operation of AI 
systems (i.e. “privacy by design”) should be a part of 
regulatory frameworks. Next to regulation, the setting 
and defining of standards is needed to verify, validate 
and monitor AI systems and assess long-term ethical 
implications185. 
The EU’s Digital Strategy highlights the impor-
tance of setting rules and standards that align 
with EU values. The Strategy includes two important 
legislative proposals: the AI Act and Data Governance 
Act. The AI Act is based on the need for EU to ensure 
the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI 
as a tool for people and for increasing human well-be-
ing. The legislation will ensure a well-functioning inter-
nal market, while assessing both potential benefits and risks186. The Data Governance Act recently proposed by 
the European Commission will continue to support the 
establishment of common European data spaces that 
comply with fundamental rights. 
Through the involvement in the World Trade Or-
ganisation Joint Statement initiative negotia-
tions on e-commerce, the EU is engaged in shap-
ing global rules on digital trade187. The EU’s General 
Data Protection Regulation has also shown the potential 
of the EU to set global standards in the area of digital 
technologies. In fact, since its implementation in 2018, 
it has been already used as a model for privacy legisla-
tion across the world. 
Open and multilateral technological standards are 
needed. The EU is working on implementing technical 
standards worldwide for the deployment of AI systems 
that are compliant with new EU regulations. It is im-
portant to have diverse stakeholders working on setting 
such standards in a number of areas, such as training 
of data, record keeping, information provision, transpar-
ency188. lt is crucial that the EU ensures its values and 
ethical guidelines are taken into account in international 
AI standardisation189.
It is essential for Europe to ensure information 
systems interoperability through standardisation. 
Standardisation is among the ‘key interoperability en-
ablers’, necessary for the efficient and effective delivery 
of public services across EU administrations190. Interop-
erability is key for making maximum use of data and 
it is placed at heart of the European digital strategy191. 
A reinforced interoperability strategy between EU gov-
ernments has been scheduled for the end of 2021. It 
will ensure coordination and set common standards 
for secure and borderless public sector data flows and 
services. Such standardisation will allow for the de-Figure 8. The Revealed Comparative Advantage indicator182: EU specialisation in the area of Robotics,

ployment of interoperable technologies respecting EU’s 
rules. It will promote EU’s approach and interests on the 
global stage. Without interoperability, the EU will miss 
the opportunity to lead the global digital technologies’ 
market. 
Technological standards could also play a signif-
icant role in the development of industry 5.0. In-
dustry 5.0 complements the existing Industry 4.0 ‘tech-
no-economic vision’ and approach of the Commission. 
The goal of industry 5.0192 is to use research and inno-
vation to build a more sustainable, human-centric and 
resilient industry. It goes beyond digitalisation for profit 
(industry 4.0) and points to the need to achieve benefits 
for all of society and to reduce generational and digital-
isation divides and respect planetary boundaries. This 
could contribute to a more environmentally friendly, ef-
ficient industry, including in the ICT sector, as well as to 
the wellbeing of workers - who industry 5.0 puts at the 
centre of the production process. 
Future opportunities and challenges
Open source software
Open source software has the potential to become 
an important element of the EU’s technological 
landscape. Open source software is computer code 
that is made publicly accessible by design. The Open 
Source Software Strategy (2020-2023) of the European 
Commission serves as a tool to achieve digital trans-
formation193. There are four main advantages of open 
source technologies: 
1. innovation (based on the decentralised process of 
code production and the large community of devel-
opers that contribute to it);
2. transparency (offering the possibility to update and 
modify source code, or test for relevance for other 
use); 
3. lower cost (free download and less costly); and 
4. longevity (it has higher chances not to be abandoned 
and instead to be taken over by the community to 
ensure its relevance for future applications)194.
Open source has been providing a significant eco-
nomic impact to the EU’s GDP. The economic impact 
of Open Source Software on the EU economy was es-timated to be between EUR 65 and EUR 95 billion in 
2018. A 10% increase of code contributions would gen-
erate around EUR 100 billion in additional EU GDP per 
year and around 1,000 more ICT start-ups per year in 
the EU195. Boosting its uptake is key for availing of the 
large opportunities that it can provide.
Open source software provides an opportuni-
ty for the EU to lead the development of dig-
ital technologies. It can contribute strongly to-
wards European digital sovereignty (i.e. EU’s ability 
to act independently in the digital world)196. Open 
source can give EU a chance to create and main-
tain its own, independent digital approach and stay 
in control of its processes, its information and its 
technology197. This is because it enables incremen-
tal innovation and technical solutions through the 
sharing of knowledge and skills, the use and reuse 
of software by small enterprises, thus increasing 
security and avoiding vendor lock-in. 
The convergence of open source with AI has a 
high innovation potential. This could be import-
ant for both the public and private sectors. In the 
context of open government and open data, it could 
stimulate economic activities. The open data mar-
ket size is estimated at €184 billion and forecasted 
to reach between €199.51 and €334.21 billion in 
2025198. At the same time, it can lead to enhanced 
transparency and trust by citizens. European gov-
ernments have affirmed the importance of open 
source software in public sector works, by incorpo-
rating it in their political and legal frameworks (24 
out of 27 EU MS), as a part of broader digitalisation 
initiatives199. However, for the moment, many open-
source projects have been funded and sustained by 
some of the US digital giant companies, such as 
Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple200.
There are several key benefits of open source 
investments related to European digital sov-
ereignty. They include improved access to source 
code, supporting open standards and consequently 
interoperability, labour saving costs and indepen-
dence from proprietary providers of software201. 
The Berlin declaration  signed in December 2020 
28
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDreaffirms open source software as a facilitator for 
deploying digital tools and capacities in the pub-
lic sector as well as interoperability202.  In connec-
tion to the use of open source, legal, technical, risk 
management and ethical challenges need to be 
taken into account as well203.
Open source software is not the same as open 
standards. Open standards are a set or a framework 
“of specification that has been approved by a recog-
nized organization”204. Open standards have many 
benefits, including interoperability of different technol-
ogy systems (that sustains the growth of software and 
hardware industries), enhanced data exchange, better 
data protection, fostering innovation (by providing a 
technological base) and transparency, ensuring eco-
nomic growth205. 
Open source software combined with open stan-
dards can produce social and economic benefits. 
Open source developers have the preference to use open 
standards. Open source software can support market adop-
tion of open standards. At the same time, the transparency 
on which open source software is based can improve trust 
in interoperability206.
Accelerating digital transformation
The acceleration of the digital transformation will 
profoundly affect economics, politics, security and 
international affairs in the coming decades. The 
mainstreaming of digital technologies and AI will boost 
economic growth but also favour some countries and 
regions over others. Through impacting a range of sec-
tors and services, AI could boost global GDP by 14%, or 
EUR 13 trillion by 2030, with the biggest gains in Chi-
na (+26%) and North America (+14.5%), whereas EU’s 
GDP would be increased by between 10 and 11%207. 
Additional potential for savings has been estimated. For 
example, e-Health solutions could bring savings, while 
increasing the quality of and access to healthcare208. 
The majority of firms will have adopted three key 
digital technologies by 2030. These are big data 
analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), and AI (machine 
learning)209. This could lead to increased productivity 
worldwide. In the EU, it is expected that the cumula-
tive additional GDP contribution of new digital tech-
nologies could amount to €2.2 trillion in the EU, which represents an increase of 14.1% compared to 2017210. 
The increasingly strategic use of AI in the public and 
private sectors, including in the functioning of key pub-
lic services, highlights the importance of factoring in AI 
and related technologies (or their potential) in critical 
industries and in green and digital transitions211. In the 
case of IoT212, there is often the need to introduce edge 
computing architectures. An effective implementation 
of AI includes reinforced connectivity through radio 
spectrum coordination, 5G mobile networks and opti-
cal fibres, next generation clouds, satellite and cyber-
security technologies. 
Raising the investment level of private and pub-
lic actors in digital technologies will be essential 
to support innovation. The EU and Member States 
will need to contribute about €75 billion per year for 
ICT investment in the next decade213. AI attracts rapid-
ly growing investments, with global spending expected 
to jump from EUR 31 billion in 2019 to about EUR 81 
billion in 2023214. 
The new initiative “Digital compass”215 identifies 
main goals that Europe should reach in order to 
achieve the EU’s vision for digital future that em-
powers people and businesses. These goals include 
digitally skilled population and professionals, secure in-
frastructures, digital transformation of businesses and 
digitalisation of public services. The Compass will be 
aligned with the newly created JRC Digital Resilience 
Dashboard216.
Europe will reinforce its innovation capacity 
through technologies at the interface between 
defence, space and civil uses, such as cloud, pro-
cessors, cyber, quantum and artificial intelligence. 
The Commission’s Action Plan on synergies between civ-
il, defence and space industries217 is an important step 
to ensure that EU will have the necessary capabilities to 
enhance both its own resilience and innovation. The goal 
for the Action Plan, together with the European Defence 
Fund is to further enhance EU’s technological edge and 
support its industrial base. 
Europe needs to invest in developing its own ca-
pacities in areas such as 5G and 6G, supercom-
puting, edge computing, and cloud infrastructure. 
A foundation for an open data infrastructure, based on 
European values and characterised by openness, trans-
parency and connection between EU Member States 
is needed. Several promising European start-ups and 
29scale-ups (e.g. Livestorm, Hopin, Wonder, Teooh, Where-
by) are already working on the development of such 
platforms218.
Edge computing219 can offer solutions that are 
secure and distributed at or near the edge of a 
computing network. The increasing number of IoT 
devices, that is doubling every five years, creates cy-
ber-security risks220. Together with the growth of the 
use of cloud computing (which had been ‘exploding’ 
and which has grown even more due to the COVID-19 
pandemic), common solutions are needed in the form 
of hyperscale cloud providers that can develop solu-
tions to distribute their cloud capabilities closer to the 
edge. However, it is estimated that by the end of 2023, 
only 20% of edge computing platforms will be man-
aged by hyperscale cloud providers, (compared to less 
than 1% in 2020)221. 
Europe needs scalable computing infrastructures. 
Data virtualisation222 and cloud computing tools and 
services that can manage and analyse big data in short 
amounts of time, are a growing market currently domi-
nated by US companies (Google cloud, AWS, IBM cloud, 
Microsoft Azure). With the rising number of connected 
devices in the Internet of Things, it is estimated that 
80% of data will be processed close to the user, in edge 
computing. 
Europe’s reliance on the digital infrastructure and 
economy during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight-
ed the need for sustained investments and do-
mestic capabilities that can increase its strategic 
autonomy. The pandemic has shown the fundamental 
value of digital collaborative and communication plat-
forms for social welfare, work, education, communica-
tion, as well as the functioning of the economy. The lack 
of a European collaborative platform and the depen-
dency on non-European platforms meant that citizens 
had to rely on foreign platforms and had to share data 
with them. This pointed to gaps in European technologi-
cal sovereignty223. This influence of non-EU tech compa -
nies has become a concern for EU policy-makers, espe-
cially with regard to their impact on EU privacy and data 
protection and on the establishment of a secure and safe 
digital environment, but also with regard to the EU’s data 
economy and innovation potential.  
Cloud and edge computing can contribute to the 
increase of Europe’s data sovereignty224. Europe 
can profit from the creation of synergies and European networks. A European Alliance on Industrial Data, Edge 
and Cloud will enable the development of Joint invest-
ments in cross-border cloud infrastructures and ser-
vices to build the next generation cloud supply; Europe-
an marketplaces for cloud services, EU Cloud Rulebook 
for cloud services. They will ensure that EU’s standards, 
rules, and best practices for cloud and edge computing 
use are applied. Cloud computing and edge computing 
could contribute to achieving the sustainability goals 
of the European Green Deal (e.g. in farming, mobility, 
buildings and manufacturing). Alongside regulation, in-
vesting in edge computing is key for the EU. 
Key Digital Technologies
The EU is currently heavily reliant on core and 
fundamental technologies sourced from outside 
its borders. The EU is lagging behind on crucial tech-
nological infrastructure such as semiconductors and su-
perfast telecoms networks. Reasserting its computing 
power, having control over data, and securing connec-
tivity are key for technological sovereignty of the EU. 
This can be achieved for example, by doubling semi-
conductor chip production in the EU, providing safe data 
storage and robust internet platforms.
Key Digital Technologies are electronic and pho-
tonic components, and the software that defines 
how they work in a system. They underpin all digital 
systems including AI and the IoT. One of the main driv-
ers towards EU’s digital sovereignty will be its capacity 
to produce high-quality microelectronics225. 
Chip shortages that occurred during COVID-19 re-
vealed Europe’s dependence in the area of semi-
conductors. The EU is supporting the global efforts of 
the G20 and WTO to monitor and keep critical supply 
chains open, while trying to increase and enhance its 
resilience and the sustainability of supply chains. Open 
source chips, as one of the most advanced areas of the 
open source hardware, could be beneficial for different 
European industry sectors, such as the automotive in-
dustry, edge computing, data storage solutions, aero-
space, energy and health226. 
The newly launched Key Digital Technologies part-
nership on microelectronics will support the dig-
ital transformation of all economic and societal 
sectors227. This partnership contributes to the supply 
of clean, affordable and secure energy, resource-effi-
cient buildings, sustainable and smart mobility, as well 
as healthy and environment-friendly food supply chains

conductor chips, in particular processors, are of growing 
importance in data processing for data infrastructure 
and communication, high-end and general purpose 
computing and future applications such as autonomous 
driving228.
Expanding digital connectivity
It is estimated that the number of connected de-
vices globally might increase from 30.4 billion in 
2020 to 200 billion in 2030229. Hyper-connectivity 
is driving an increased convergence of industries, prod-
ucts, technologies and services. High-performance com-
puting (HPC) and AI will increasingly converge with new 
computing, storage and communication technologies.  
High Performance Computing has been identified 
as a strategic investment priority to underpin the 
EU’s digital strategy, from big data analytics and 
AI to cloud and cybersecurity. In order to strengthen 
HPC innovation capabilities and supercomputing capac-
ity, the European Commission has proposed a budget 
of over €8 billion through a HPC Joint Undertaking in 
the period 2021-2033230.  This will come from Horizon 
Europe, Digital Europe programmes, Connecting Europe 
Facility as well as participating Member States and pri-
vate partners. 
Next generation mobile network technologies is a 
key enabler for the industrial internet of things. 
Fast connectivity based on 5G and successors is an op-
portunity for technology leap in numerous industries 
from remote robotic surgery, autonomous mobility, 
precision farming and livestock management. Secure 
real-time connection to central cloud servers enable 
smart process management onsite and in mobile ap-
plications231. 5G satellites enable wide area digital high 
speed connectivity; they allow provision of smart ser-
vices, beyond densely populated urban areas232. Com-
binations of ubiquitous network and high performance 
computing technology will create a transformative po-
tential for society, in areas such as virtual education, 
remote work, access to health care in rural areas233.  
One of the challenges for the EU is industry con-
vergence that represents a growth opportuni-
ty for foreign digital giants. Global firms active in 
digital markets are merging or making acquisitions to 
bridge into often-unrelated markets, disrupting the in-
dustry and society234. This gives rise to powerful global 
operators such as Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Tencent. For example, Alphabet acquired more than 200 
companies, among others: YouTube (acquired in 2006); 
Motorola (acquired in 2011); Deep Mind Technologies 
(acquired in 2014); and FitBit (acquired in 2021).
The alliance of global corporate players is inten-
sifying global competition. In order to prevent poten-
tial harmful effects on competition (as some mergers 
can reduce competition), the EU Merger Regulation235 
provides the regulatory framework for the assessment, 
review and approval of mergers, acquisitions and joint 
ventures in the EU. Some of the previous examples that 
were assessed by the European Commission are the re-
view of Microsoft-Skype (in 2011), Microsoft-Linkedin 
(in 2016), and more recently Google-Fitbit (in 2020) 
acquisitions (under its umbrella company Alphabet). A 
reform of the Merger Regulation started in 2021. This 
will be especially important for digital sector and start-
up acquisitions236. In parallel, the US Federal Trade Com-
mission is expected to reform its approach to antitrust, 
through expansion of antitrust enforcement that will 
impact digital giants in the US237. 
The use of non-European data services poses a 
concern for European industries. GAIA-X, a network 
of cloud computing and data services, will try to chal-
lenge and provide an alternative to the dominance of 
big tech companies. It is  developed under the EU legis-
lation, thus implementing privacy by design (as a legal 
requirement of the GDPR). Through collaboration be-
tween business (more than 100 European companies), 
science and politics on the European level and beyond, 
the goal of this next generation open source data infra-
structure will be to provide “a secure, federated system 
with highest standards of digital sovereignty while pro-
moting innovation”238. This would be a foundation of an 
EU-wide interconnected open data infrastructure, based 
on European values and law. Therefore it is important to 
ensure that two of its seven key principles, digital sov-
ereignty and self-determination  and free market access 
and European value creation  remain priorities for this 
initiative239. The first GAIA-X services are expected by 
the end of 2021240.
Deepening impact of AI in society
The digitalisation and automation of a number of 
tasks will carry far-reaching implications for Eu-
ropean societies. It will affect the workforce in terms 
of jobs lost, requirements for (re)training and potentially 
widening inequalities within societies241. Estimates differ 
widely, but between 75 and 375 million workers world-
31wide may need to change their occupation between 
2016 and 2030242. The reallocation process for work-
ers to find new jobs might be a longer process calls for 
respective social policies243. Before the COVID-19 pan-
demic, it was estimated that around 14% of EU workers 
could face a risk of job loss due to automation244. This 
has been further accentuated since the pandemic. How-
ever, re-training and education might counteract auto-
mation displacement. The societal aspect of frictions in 
individual careers also affects the intrinsic value of jobs, 
like meaning, dignity and fulfilment245. This calls for a 
broader response beyond education and training. While 
activities using manual, physical or basic cognitive skills 
will decline, activities that require technological skills as 
well as socio-emotional skills will increase246. 
The full extent of social and ethical impact of AI is 
still uncertain. With the increased use of digital tech-
nologies, it is crucial to consider social and ethical chal-
lenges that could emerge from their use. These include 
issues regarding fairness and bias in machine learning, 
human dignity and autonomy, impact on humans via 
recommendations and nudging, safety and liability247. 
While digital technologies such as AI can be a driver of 
progress, they can also lead to discriminations, increase 
illegal hate speech, digital surveillance, or the vulner-
abilities of certain societal groups248. For example, the 
emergence of emotion AI, i.e. ‘affect recognition tech-
nology’249 based on facial recognition looks at micro-ex-
pressions i.e. what people say, how they say it and what 
expressions they make. This technology is receiving at-
tention in job interviews, criminal suspect examinations, 
or for setting insurance prices, and it could lead to bias-
es. Racial biases have been noticed250, but also biases in 
hiring, and in pain assessment251. Similarly, in connec-
tion to the use of citizens’ data with data analytics used 
as a basis for behavioural targeting and personalised 
advertising, some organisations are proposing a right 
“not to be measured, analysed or coached”252. 
This is why it is important to ensure that human 
rights and the freedoms of people are respect-
ed while they use AI. Despite many known issues re-
garding fairness, accountability, transparency and eth-
ical biases that are built into them, the competition for 
global leadership means that these technologies may 
be implemented faster than expected (and faster than 
regulation can keep up).  
The advancements in a ‘smarter’ digitally con-
nected society pose further human rights issues that go beyond privacy as well as cybersecurity 
threats. This is especially important for the second 
generation of IoT, where borders between the physi-
cal and virtual worlds become blurred. These devices 
can take autonomous decisions beyond just collecting 
data. It presents both challenges and opportunities for 
the future. For example, digital technologies drive a 
transformation of city infrastructures into “smart” cit-
ies, modelled in digital twins, to become more user-driv-
en and demand focused253. The applications go beyond 
optimisation of smart buildings, autonomous mobility, 
energy infrastructure254, etc., to the internet of the body, 
where medical implants (such as pacemaker, cochlear 
implants or in the future digestible pills and brain com-
puter interfaces) communicate to central cloud255. 
The creation of a European data space will con-
tribute to ensure a better availability and man-
agement of data for all. The European data strategy 
and the proposed European data act lays down a path 
towards the creation of European data spaces to ensure 
that more data becomes available for use in the econo-
my and society, while keeping companies and individu-
als in control of their data. This can benefit citizens and 
businesses through for example: improving healthcare, 
creating new products and services, or providing public 
services that are more efficient256.
A common EU approach and action on AI ethics 
would be beneficial for all EU economic sectors. 
It is estimated that a common EU approach to ethical 
aspects of AI has the potential to generate between 
Europe could 
further attract 
talent and 
prevent brain 
drain through 
support to deep 
tech start-ups.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND€221.8 and 294.9 billion in additional GDP and 3.3 to 
4.6 million additional jobs for the European Union by 
2030257. 
Digital technology, including AI, could bring inno-
vation opportunities into the public sector, im-
prove interaction between government and citi-
zens through the simplification of procedures and 
contribute to open government258. The full digital-
isation of public services will become common in digi-
tally advanced future societies. At the core of the Com-
mission’s e-government Action Plan is the development 
of cross-border digital public services259.
Digital Innovation Hubs and smart specialisation
The EU is not as strong as the US or China in the 
digital sector. Despite ranking in the top three, the EU 
has a smaller digital proportion of ICT sector260 (1.7 % 
of GDP), compared to China (2.1%) and the US (3.3%). 
A recent European Investment Bank report261 indicates 
that established EU firms are weaker than their US 
counterparts. They lag behind in adopting digital tech-
nologies, particularly in the Internet of Things and the 
construction sector. In the latter, the gap is significant 
with the share of digital firms standing at 40% com-
pared to 61% in the US. The adoption rates of digital 
technology differ between EU and US firms also in ser-
vice (13%) and infrastructure sectors (11%). 
As critical sources of innovation, small and medi-
um size enterprises (SMEs) are considered to have 
a central role in the digital transformation. How-
ever, before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was estimated 
that 90% of European SMEs are not taking full advan-
tage of digitalisation opportunities262.
COVID-19 stressed the important role of Digital 
Innovation Hubs (DIHs)263. Hubs are ‘one-stop shops’ 
that help companies with aspects of the digital trans-
formation. A research and technology organisation, or a 
university lab is at the core of the hub, in collaboration 
with other partners. In this way, SMEs can benefit from 
artificial intelligence, digital skills and cybersecurity. 
Digital innovation hubs help companies to become 
more competitive through experimentation and 
testing. They can give quick and easy access to techno-
logical infrastructures for experimentation and testing 
with new digital technologies, such as AI, High Perfor-
mance Computing, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, Photonics, 
3D printing. This allows an understanding of the future 
opportunities and return on investments for companies (in relation to digitalisation options for their business). 
They can also provide financial advice and train-
ing. In this way, they help to accelerate the digital 
transformation of the economy and society throughout 
the EU, helping to overcome the possible negative con-
sequences of the COVID-19 crisis and strengthen inno-
vation ecosystems. For example, boot camps, trainee-
ships, exchange of curricula and training material can 
be organised. Digital innovation hubs can also support 
organisations to find investments. New business models 
and innovative products, as well as ways of work, will be 
needed for the future. For example, adopting data-driv-
en business models and solutions that protect against 
cyber threats are among the most important.
Several issues are key for innovative and smart 
economic transition. These are: enhancing R&I ca-
pacities, harvesting digitalisation benefits, supporting 
growth and competitiveness of SMEs, and developing 
skills for smart specialisation. The European Commis-
sion smart specialisation strategy264 in the period 2021-
2027 includes among others: analysis of bottlenecks for 
innovation diffusion and digitalisation, improvement of 
national or regional research and innovation systems, 
as well as managing industrial transition and its im-
pacts. Digital innovation is one of the smart specialisa-
tion priorities265. Boosting digitalisation will help imple-
ment smart specialisation strategies and boost SMEs’ 
innovation capacities.266
European Digital Innovation Hubs will be funded 
through a newly established Digital Europe Pro-
gramme267. The newly established programme will 
support projects through funding in five key capacity 
areas:  supercomputing, artificial intelligence, cyberse-
curity, advanced digital skills, and ensuring a wide use 
of digital technologies across the economy and society, 
including through Digital Innovation Hubs. It isestimated 
that by 2023, EUR 310 million will be injected into Digi-
tal Innovation Hubs that will offer local support to SMEs 
for their digital transformation and access to technology 
testing268. By then, three out of four companies should 
use cloud computing services, big data and Artificial In-
telligence and more than 90% SMEs should reach at 
least basic level of digital intensity269.
Key Enabling Technologies
The European Commission identified several tech-
nologies as strategic for the EU’s industrial fu-
ture, with the possibility to impact both the econ-
33omy and society. Key Enabling Technologies (KETs)270 
will allow European industries to remain competitive 
and capitalise on new markets. Some of the prioritised 
KETs271 are: advanced manufacturing, advanced mate-
rials, micro/nano-electronics and photonics, artificial in-
telligence and cybersecurity. 
KETs drive innovation with a trend towards full 
convergence and integration of industries. They 
sustain EU’s leadership across industrial value chains 
and have the capacity to contribute to improvement 
of people’s health and safety, and reversing climate 
change272.
KETs have been financed through several EU re-
search framework programmes. For example, they 
are financed through Horizon Europe, the EU’s R&I pro-
gramme for the period 2021-2027. They were also 
funded in Horizon 2020, the previous programme with 
nearly €80 billion of public funding dispersed over sev-
en years (2014-2020).  Other instruments, such as the 
5G-PPP, a new AI and Blockchain Investment Fund, and 
a large-scale research initiative to foster the develop-
ment of a competitive quantum industry in the EU, is 
supporting companies working in the AI and blockchain 
sectors273.
Blockchain
The EU wants to strengthen its position in block-
chain and distributed ledgers technologies (DLTs). 
Blockchain has the potential to revolutionise the way 
we share information and carry out transactions online. 
However, there are still several unresolved issues in-
cluding high-energy consumption, protection of person-
al data, scalability and performance, as well as interop-
erability274. Although environmental concerns around 
bitcoin275 have been raised, it is believed that blockchain 
will lead the way to a sustainable global economy276. 
The goal of the EU’s strategy on blockchain is to 
build a more secure online environment for EU cit-
izens and businesses. The application of blockchain is 
seen in spaces such as financial inclusion277, fair supply 
chains, energy and environment, identities and vulner-
able populations, or skills and education. It often leads 
to blurring the boundaries and enhancing collaborations 
between public, private and third sectors278. 
The European Commission wants to support block-
chain and DLTs that embrace European values and 
the EU legal and regulatory framework279. Particular 
standards that are required include environmental sus-tainability, data protection, enhanced e-identity frame-
work, provision of cybersecurity and interoperability. EU 
research funding, blockchain investment fund and start-
up support help European innovation that implements 
and materialises the EU standards for blockchain. 
European Blockchain Services Infrastructure is 
the first EU-wide blockchain infrastructure and 
was built through the European Blockchain Part-
nership. Its goal is to leverage blockchain for the 
creation of cross-border services for public ad-
ministrations. Consequently, their ecosystems 
could be used to verify information and make 
them trustworthy and transparent280. Similarly, 
the European Union’s Blockchain Observatory has al-
ready discussed the benefits of establishing a block-
chain-based digital identity system (to both secure and 
share data and records), as well as the digitisation of 
national currencies281. Blockchain-based central bank 
digital currencies could help overcome current vulner-
abilities (e.g. enhancing security) and enable financial 
innovations and modernisation282.
Deep technology
There is a new European vision aiming to support 
future excellent science and innovation, which 
consists of scaling up deep-tech start-ups. A deep 
tech is  a company whose business model is based in 
engineering innovation, or significant scientific discovery, 
having both R&D risk and product-market risk. It spans 
across many technologies, e.g. AI, robotics, blockchain, 
advanced material science, photonics and electronics, 
biotech and quantum computing that are trying to solve 
some of the most pressing challenges such as food, 
health, energy, mobility283. Deep tech284 is essential in 
innovation ecosystems. Several current tech giants ei-
ther have emerged from deep tech or are currently do-
ing deep tech. They propose revolutionary solutions to 
global problems, with the disruptive potential to create 
entirely new markets. However, these companies usu-
ally have a longer R&D cycle and need more time and 
more capital investment to develop, with many failing 
(especially if they do not receive funding on time). The 
value of European deep tech companies is almost  €700 
billion combined285 and is raising steadily (Figure 9).
Many promising EU start-ups are  being bought by 
foreign companies, or go public abroad286. The so-
called “killer acquisitions” that occasionally occur could 
harm both innovation and competition. This happens 
when a company acquires “innovative targets solely to 
34
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDdiscontinue the target’s innovation projects and pre-
empt future competition”287. It is important for the EU to 
encourage, stimulate and fund innovators, researchers 
and enterpreneurs. Based on this, innovation opportuni-
ties for industry in the EU will emerge288. 
A large number of European governments have 
included AI, quantum computing and cybersecu-
rity among the prioritised fields for the future. 
For example, by June 2021, twenty Member States had 
published national AI strategies, while seven were in 
the final phase of drafting them289. Quantum computing 
and its use in cybersecurity (i.e. quantum cryptography) 
could play an important role in safeguarding critical and 
personal data290. With the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 
role of BioNTech in vaccine development, biotech start-
ups found themselves in the spotlight. Europe’s role in 
biotech is growing and European companies can play 
an important role in the future291. The big success of 
BioNTech highlights the need for long-term R&D and 
stronger EU capital markets292. BioNTech received EUR 
9.8 million from EU funding between 2008 and 2018, 
while it was still in the development phase293. Alongside health-related companies, some other the key inno-
vation domains are cybersecurity and climate change. 
Aligned with the EU policy agenda, these fields repre-
sent business and innovation opportunities294. 
Europe could further attract talent and prevent 
brain drain through support to deep tech start-
ups. Scaling up in deep tech is key to translating the 
talent and innovation into economic growth of the re-
gions of Europe and keep talent in European compa-
nies295. For the accelerated innovations, talent and skills 
are needed. Better connections between start-ups and 
different societal actors are also needed (such as in-
vestors, academia, policymakers, SMEs, citizens)296. As a 
part of this strategy, the European Commission recently 
announced a new initiative called ‘Women TechEU’ to 
support women leading deep tech start-ups in Europe, 
and to help grow their companies into tomorrow’s deep 
tech champions297. 
Some deep tech start-ups are the so-called “uni-
corns”. Unicorns are start-ups with a value over $ 1 
billion298. Compared to the EU, the US and China are Figure 9. Combined value (EUR billion) of European-founded Deep Tech companies.

leading considerably in the number of tech unicorns: the 
US has approximately 10 times more and China has ap-
proximately 5 times more tech unicorns.299. Increasing 
the number of unicorns in this area could better sus-
tain the EU technology ecosystem and would create EU 
technology giants. One of the targets of Digital com-
pass is for the EU to double the number of EU tech uni-
corns by 2030300.
There is still much potential to be unlocked, es-
pecially as some start-ups work in a cross-dis-
ciplinary manner, which attracts different talent 
and investment in R&D cycles. Unequal regulations 
across Member States and a lack of clear focus in the 
innovation strategy impedes EU companies’ develop-
ment. Early support from governments and EU funds 
could help the EU ensure tech leadership in the future301. 
The newly established European Innovation Council pro-
vides a €10 billion budget for the period 2021-2027 for 
breakthrough technologies and game changing innova-
tions and their scaling up. The EIC will support start-
ups, SMEs and research teams developing high-risk, 
high-impact breakthrough innovation, especially those 
that contribute to the European Green Deal and the Re-
covery Plan for Europe302.
Further developments in deep tech will be instru-
mental for the economy, but also society. Many en-
terpreneurs believe deep tech could help solve some of 
the challenges Europe faces today and in the future.303 
The unicorn leaders have recently proposed:
• sovereign EU Tech fund; 
• provision of substantial funding for the procure-
ment of innovative technologies; 
• sovereign EU Green Tech fund;
• commitment to becoming fully carbon neutral by 
2030;
• scaling up Important Projects of Common European 
Interest (IPCEI)  framework for deep tech (e.g. quan-
tum computing, 6G, and green hydrogen); 
• upgrade of immigration process for talents through 
EU Blue Card 2.0; 
• channelling the investment into EU small valleys of 
excellence, a pan-EU sandbox304.

This section describes the key elements that are shaping the economic dimension of the EU’s open 
strategic autonomy, both in the present and towards 2040 and beyond. The infographic below de-
picts the EU’s existing strengths that are key to addressing current weaknesses and vulnerabilities, upcoming 
challenges, as well as to seizing underlying opportunities; each of them are elaborated in more detail in this 
section. Briefly, Europe is building on its economic power in the single market, its regulatory power to balance 
interdependencies, but it has to deal with one-sided dependencies in several areas. To leverage the EU’s global 
position, it has to strengthen the competitiveness of its economy, manage the green and digital transition, 
balance interdependencies, and grow its regulatory power and political influence to achieve a level playing 
field in global trade. At the same time, it has to strengthen institutional capacities to be able to act in a more 
fragmented global economy in the future.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDCurrent strengths and weaknesses
The EU should  be able to set objectives and mo-
bilise the necessary resources without depending 
on the decisions and assets of others305. Europe 
wants to develop its economy in line with its interests 
and values, and to be able to deal with growing eco-
nomic competition in a more volatile international sys-
tem306. One-sided structural dependencies from foreign 
countries, or market actors, need to be avoided. The 
goal is twofold: to decrease asymmetric dependencies 
and enhance Europe’s regulatory power. Leveraging the 
full potential of the Single Market, and achieving and 
enforcing a level playing field with other major econ-
omies are the essential steps to uphold Europe’s com-
petitiveness and sustain growth. By doing so the EU can 
preserve the economic power base that underpins its 
regulatory power and open strategic autonomy307.
Key strengths of the EU with respect to open 
strategic autonomy are its market and regulato-
ry power. Also, its good connections in the world and 
its ability to balance an open economy while upholding 
economic resilience and strategic autonomy. Key ar-
eas for improvements include increasing the resilience 
of global supply chains, adapting competition policy to 
global challenges, and keeping control of key hubs for 
trade to avoid foreign interference in the EU’s global 
economic flows.Europe’s economic power and global interlinkage 
The EU has a powerful economy with global in-
fluence. As the second largest world economy and the 
third largest in terms of purchasing power parity after 
China and the US, the EU wields significant economic 
power. The EU’s GDP (13,900 billion euro in 2019) ac-
counts for about one-sixth of the global economy at 
current price (see Figures 6). Figure 10 shows the evolu-
tion in purchasing power parity308. With over €3.1 trillion 
exports (i.e. 17.3% of the world share) and €2.8 trillion 
imports (i.e. 15.6%) of goods and services in 2019, the 
EU is the main partner in world trade for 74 countries, 
as compared to China (66) and the US (31)309, as shown 
in Figure 11310. 
The Single Market is a strong pillar of Europe’s 
economy. It is one of the key pillars of the Europe-
an project, driving European integration, the EU’s inter-
nal cohesion and external economic action. Being  the 
world’s largest single market area, it is under the top 
three largest economies, able to influence global prices 
and trade volumes. Intra-EU trade of goods is approx-
imately 1.5 times higher than extra-EU trade311. The 
economic power of the European economy and its inte-
gration with a diversity of global partners are strongly 
needed312 to advance in open strategic autonomy. 
There is an added benefit to the diversity of Euro-
pean economies.Figure 10: EU gross domestic product in purchasing power parity and its share of global gross domestic

39The diversity of EU Member States’ economies with 
different sectoral foci and various international inter-
dependencies (including the dominant intra-EU trade), 
makes the EU economy more resilient to international 
trade volatility. Europe is quite diverse between its North 
and South, West and East in terms of different economic 
structures and stages of economic development, with 
diversity in technological, commercial, financial and in-
stitutional environments314. Diversity provides a variety 
of regional specific competitive advantages in terms of 
labour costs, productivity, and specialised knowledge, 
which are thereby available in the Single Market along 
with the four fundamental freedoms of movement 
of goods, services, capital and people315. Europe has 
strength in economic autonomy in many areas that en-
ables it to balance global interdependencies. However, 
diverging political and economic interests across Mem-
ber States limit the political capacity to speak as one EU 
voice in multilateral settings.
Global reach of European economic policies
Trade policy in Europe has proven effective. Mem-
ber States have agreed on a shared concept trade pol-
icy, with the principles of: i) openness, ii) rules and iii) 
competition. This open market policy has been promot-
ed as a means to an end, including helping developing 
countries to open up to trade and using trade agree-
ments to advance EU values. Increasingly, trade agen-
das include non-commercial objectives such as the pro-
motion of fundamental political and human rights from quality and environmental standards to labour rights. 
Europe is able to play out a proactive agenda by pro-
jecting the EU’s own values and approaches to foreign 
partners and the multilateral partner level. In this way 
Europe preserves the capacity to act in the world and 
govern globalisation, thus strengthening its resilience 
against the risks of interdependence316. 
The EU is expanding alliances with like-minded 
foreign partners. 36 major trade agreements with 
65 countries cover 30% of the EU’s global trade317. The 
global coverage of EU trade agreements in place, in rat-
ification or negotiation is presented in Figure 12.  The EU 
draws on an institutional requirement for open strategic 
autonomy, as it speaks with one voice when negotiat-
ing trade agreements, monitoring their implementation, 
and when responding to unfair trade practices. 
The European Single Market is the most advanced 
and integrated economic union. Based on the European 
experience and learnings in the process to build the single 
market, the EU can help foreign partners to advance their 
emerging bilateral and regional trade agreements, while 
proposing the application of values and norms that are 
compatible with the EU’s at the same time. This is timely, as 
the number of trade agreements is currently growing318. Be-
yond widening the network of EU trade agreements, the EU 
is also proactively working at a multilateral level to improve 
the functioning of the World Trade Organisation, and to-
wards regulating unfair trade practices across the world319.Figure 11: Annual growth rate of extra-EU trade in goods (in percentage) and trade balance (in billion euro)

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDThe EU can tackle threats that derive from an open 
economy. Threats to the EU economy due to its openness 
include asymmetric restrictions on foreign investments, 
further exposure of EU industries, unfair competition 
from foreign heavily state-backed companies. However, 
the EU has put together an effective set of instruments to 
balance one-sided influence, with balanced competition 
approaches. This includes effective trade defence instru-
ments, with anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures321. 
These are safeguarding measures to provide interim re-
lief to a sector, to protect it against imports for a limited 
period in the form of tariff-rate quotas322. And an EU-
wide foreign direct investment (FDI) screening to safe-
guard key assets and protect collective security323. The 
EU uses regulatory and market policies to balance the 
interdependence of their open economy.
European competition policy applies to foreign 
business activities in Europe. This policy aims to pro-
tect market efficiency and avoid market failure through 
antitrust law and to limit state aid and enable a level 
playing field in the single market. EU competition poli-
cies are also influential for foreign companies’ business 
activities in the EU, e.g. on Gazprom breaching antitrust 
rules in some EU Member States in 2015, or Alphabet/
Google for abusing market dominance on Android op-
eration systems in 2018324. The EU has the capacity to 
project its rules, values and standards to foreign busi-
ness and economies that threaten the openness of the 
EU’s economy. Europe has instruments to support smart spe-
cialisation. Smart specialisation is a policy approach 
to boost growth and jobs, based on regional compet-
itive advantages.  The EU is building economic devel-
opment programmes to build industrial ecosystems 
and European value chains for emerging sectors sup-
ported by research and innovation funding, such as 
the Battery Alliance325. This is an examplary economic 
response of the EU to increasing competitive distor-
tion in sectors, where foreign competitors receive stra-
tegic state support, like globally dominating Chinese 
battery manufacturering326. Smart specialisation aims 
to strengthen regional innovation systems by bringing 
together local authorities, academia, business spheres 
and civil society to implement long-term growth strat-
egies supported by EU funds327,328. The EU has a set 
of soft policy instruments to push competitiveness of 
sectors and regions. Some of them are used strategi-
cally to address the risk of dependency from foreign 
dominant market actors. 
Governance system and European of Pillar 
Social Rights
Robust public services and governance systems 
increase economic resilience in times of shocks329. 
While the impact of the pandemic has been uneven in 
countries, the ones that were positioned to quickly take 
advantage of changing economic opportunities have 
fared well. Figure 12: Map of EU free trade agreements – state of play July 2021
Abbreviations: EEA: European Economic Area, OCT: Overseas Countries and Territories
Data source: DG TRADE320 

41The countries that until November 2020 have been able 
to cope better with the COVID-19 pandemic in terms 
of mobilising actors to meet challenges on the basis of 
their functioning crisis management plans, are notably 
Nordic countries - where crisis management plans are 
required, and Asian countries - that are drawing on their 
SARS pandemic experience. They have robust political 
and governance systems in place (for crises manage-
ment), supported by state-of-the-art technologies and 
digital, health, research and other critical infrastruc-
tures331. Investments in these kinds of strategic assets 
are emerging as a priority for effective governance, 
in order to ensure economic and societal resilience to 
shocks332. These assets are instrumental requirements 
for open strategic autonomy when facing natural disas-
ters, or pandemics, or other causes of economic vola-
tility that create one-sided dependencies, such as sup-
ply bottlenecks. Building “capacity for the unforeseen, 
yet probable crisis is important when designing gover-
nance.”333
The European pillar of social rights increases the 
resilience of a workforce in times of crises. It com-
bines fundamental principles of a free market economy 
with social policies and welfare state provisions334, while 
ensuring fair competition and a level playing field in 
the internal market. The EU’s social protection systems 
are highly developed335. The pan-European support for 
short-time work arrangements (SURE) is one approach 
to increase social cohesion within the COVID-19 pan-demic-related labour market disruptions336. A strong 
social protection system supports a well-functioning 
labour market. It could increase attractiveness for tal-
ent from foreign countries, and help to overcome the 
skills gaps that exist in Europe. It also buffers the short-
term the volatility of the economic crises, and helps to 
re-activate the workforce quickly following a rebound 
of the economy. This strengthens the market power of 
the European economy, reducing temporary one-sided 
dependencies. 
Supply chain dependencies
The European economy is deeply entrenched in 
‘global value chains’. Global value networks are a 
characteristic of the highly interdependent and open 
global economies participating in production processes. 
Production processes divided into steps can utilise ad-
vantages of specialised suppliers. Cheap transportation 
costs and reduced transaction costs due to the removal 
of trade barriers has pushed the expansion of the EU’s 
global value chains. 
Global value chains have been expanding steadily 
since the early 1990s. In the global financial crisis 
of 2008/2009 their growth stalled. However, EU coun-
tries were less affected by this slow down (see Fig. X). 
They are significantly more involved in cross-border 
value chains compared to the level of the US or China. 
Relative to the global average, EU countries consume 
more foreign content compared with the ‘reverse flow’ Figure 13. Foreign value added share of gross-exports (in percent)

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDof goods and services to other countries337. This indi-
cates a relatively high dependence of EU countries on 
global supply chains. 
Strengthening the EU’s supply chains and fos-
tering the implementation of the EU connectivi-
ty strategy are central. They contribute both to re-
ducing asymmetric dependencies, and to helping shape 
multilateral regimes in line with Europe’s values and 
interests. In particular, in sensitive areas where the EU 
economy is highly dependent on open trade338, Europe 
needs to balance these dependencies through a mix of 
diversified supply chains, reshoring and near-shoring of 
critical production steps, that means having more sup-
pliers, or moving production to domestic sites or in Eu-
ropean neighbourhood.
The COVID-19 crisis led to a disruption of glob-
al supply chains, revealing the vulnerability of 
the European economy. In the first lockdown of early 
2020, manufacturing and medical supply sectors were 
affected339. Later in 2020, large shifts in consump-
tion towards digital devices led to a huge shortage of 
semiconductor chips, which affected the production 
of 4 million vehicles globally340 (and which might last 
until 2023341). In addition, container freight rates have 
surged since mid-2020, due to a gap in shipping capaci-
ty and the many empty containers342. The pandemic has 
highlighted the supply dependency that affect Europe’s 
economic power. 
The revival of the economy during the COVID-19 
crises came with unexpected market turbulences. 
Huge economic stimulus programmes in the US and Eu-
rope, due to economy recovery plans, led to skyrocket-
ing prices for all kinds of commodities from food (corn), 
metal (steel, aluminium, copper) to lumber. Some of 
them, like steel and lumber were at a very low price 
level before. China is boosting the market volatility 
by reducing production of steel and massively buying 
grain343. The strong interdependence of the economy 
has unexpected implications across all steps of global 
value networks in times of crises, that pose longer-term 
economic threats. 
Control of logistics hubs 
Globally interdependent economies are depen-
dent on their logistics hubs and borders. Europe is 
a highly interdependent economy and relies on seam-
lessly working supply chains. In March 2021, the sev-
en-day blockage of the Suez canal due to an accident, (the central gateway for shipping between Europe and 
Asia344), resulted in more than 400 ships lined up queu-
ing on both sides345. Alongside various product shipment 
delays, it caused rising oil prices and supply pressure on 
European chemicals346. This indicates the 24/7 need for 
reliable logistics chains and the vulnerability of Europe-
an economy. 
Europe has lost partial control of some of its 
critical gateways for global marine transport347: 
China has taken over the port of Piraeus, the European 
bridgehead to Asia, the Zeebrugge terminal of Belgium 
with its connections to North-western Europe, and it 
holds shares of ports in Italy, Spain and Croatia348. In 
total, China and Chinese companies now control about 
10% of Europe’s port capacities349. China’s owns the 
world’s second largest merchant marine (moving car-
go and passengers)350. Foreign powers controlling the 
transport infrastructure introduces an Achilles heel in 
the EU’s economy, and creates a one-sided dependency. 
It could turn out to be a huge threat, if these assets are 
exploited in future conflicts, e.g. through the closing of 
harbours, airports and/or rail routes, etc. 
Competition regulations
Competition laws vary globally. Attempts to har-
monise competition law at the international level 
failed a decade ago351. European competition law aims 
to ensure that single companies do not dominate the 
market due to oligo- or monopolistic size and State in-
tervention does not distort competition. In contrast, the 
US has reduced control of the concentration of com-
panies, and abuses of dominant positions are more or 
less accepted. In addition, the US do not regulate state 
aid that could distort competition. China is actively 
pushing their national champions, strategically build-
ing dominant corporations under State control, to be-
come competitive in the world352. For example in 2019, 
the European Commission prohibited a merger of the 
rail industry players Siemens and Alstom, whereas 
China went ahead and merged their rail industry into 
one company, CRRC353. Different competition laws al-
low a distortion of competition between globally active 
companies354. 
Protection of home markets distorts competition 
globally. China is protecting its home market, in partic-
ular in strategic high-tech industries. Utilising the vast 
size of the domestic market allows Chinese industry to 
build-up competitive product offerings protected from 
foreign competition. For example, the establishment of 
43Chinese solar panel manufacturing based on state sup-
port and economies of scale in the domestic market, 
beat European solar photovoltaics industry on the glob-
al market through low price offerings. While low-priced 
goods are positive for European consumers, the result-
ing erosion of European firms could weaken some key 
industries that are critical for critical infrastructures, as 
the debate on 5G network equipment supply from Chi-
nese ZTE and Huawei revealed in recent years.355
Enforcing a level playing field with other major 
economies is essential. As mentioned above, the EU 
has elements of trade and competition policies that 
contribute to balancing one-sided market dominance. 
Enforcing a level playing field contributes to uphold 
Europe’s competitiveness and sustain growth, thereby 
preserving the economic power base that underpins Eu-
rope’s regulatory power and open strategic autonomy.
Future opportunities and challenges
Developments are creating challenges for open 
strategic autonomy in three areas: 1) The shift of 
economic gravity (average location of economic activi-
ties on the globe) from established Western economies 
to Asia reduces the EU’s economic influence. 2) An in-
crease in fast-growing emerging economies might lead 
to a fragmentation of global economic interdependen-
cies. The EU risks losing competitiveness, as other econ-
omies innovate faster, are less open and more strongly 
protect their markets. 3) Global debt is rising further, 
driven by governments’ spending to help cope with 
managing the COVID-19 crises impacts. The growing 
dependencies on creditors, and limited ability for gov-
ernment spending, present challenges and further drive 
one-sided dependencies. For instance, in the EU, the 
government debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 77.5 % 
at the end of 2019 to 90.7 % at the end of 2020, the 
highest in the time series.
The economic challenges are linked to opportu-
nities too. With the fragmentation of the economic 
landscape and stress on the financial systems, the 
euro could gain a stronger international role, break-
ing up one-sided dependencies on the US dollar. 
Challenges to the competitiveness of the European 
economy and addressing the climate crisis, call for 
a progressive green and digital transition that could 
shift economic dependencies and strengthen the EU’s 
market power.Europe’s economy in the world
Europe is expected to shrink in terms of global 
economic weight, as Asian economies are grow-
ing faster. The most recent long-term economic fore-
casts are pre-COVID-19 forecasts. Disruption due to 
the pandemic continues to “paralyse most economic 
activities”356 across the world, with unprecedented job 
losses. Huge government stimulus packages prevented 
economic collapse. The UN estimates that the long-term 
impacts of the pandemic will lead to a lower growth 
trajectory (than earlier forecast)357. The pre-COVID-19 
long-term global economic perspectives were already 
rather moderate, but might need to be revised down-
wards. Pre-crisis OECD estimates expected real GDP 
growth to decline from about 3.2% in 2019, to 2.1% 
in 2040358. The E7 emerging economies (Brazil, China, 
India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Turkey) are expect-
ed to grow more than twice faster in terms of annual 
GDP growth rates, compared to G7 countries (Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US). 
The economic ‘centre of gravity’ is expected to 
shift from North America and Europe to Asia. Asian 
economic growth centres are mainly China and India, 
but also Indonesia359. The EU27 could reduce its eco-
nomic weight from 18% to about 12% share of gross 
domestic product at current prices360. This large loss of 
economic power in Europe and shift towards China, In-
dia and Indonesia, will to lead to a transformation of 
economic interdependencies between the global actors. 
[The EU] has to 
strengthen the 
competitiveness of 
its economy, manage 
the green and digital 
transition, balance 
interdependencies, 
and grow its 
regulatory power and 
political influence
44
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDThe EU’s will have less opportunity to draw on econom-
ic power for global influence362. The EU needs to build 
up other powers, such as alliances to increase its soft  
power and regulatory power, as well as a commercial 
strategy with the relevant markets. 
Foreign countries are increasingly aligning their 
geopolitical and geo-economic power to be more 
assertive. Economic powers such as the US and China 
have long been merging economic and geopolitical in-
terests. In contrast, Europe’s governance style has been 
designed to preserve external economic relationships 
from the interference of geopolitics363. Growing eco-
nomic pressures, due to the relative growth in power of 
foreign economies, combined with growing geopolitical 
tensions, could further challenge the competitiveness of 
Europe. In addition, it could affect the innovativeness 
of its industry, influence its monetary and financial au-
tonomy, and expose critical infrastructure and national 
security assets to foreign interference. To preserve the 
openness of the EU economy, balanced rules are need-
ed to enable a level playing field for foreign powers and 
industry.
Europe’s competitiveness in the world
Europe’s competitiveness level is quite diverse 
across regions. The World Economic Forum (WEF)364 
performs global competitiveness analyses looking at 
preconditions for long-term growth, using a holistic view 
of enabling environment, human capital, markets and 
innovation ecosystems365. In their pre-COVID 2019 as-
sessment, Singapore leads the ranking, followed by the 
US366 and Hong Kong. European Member States range 
between rank 4th (The Netherlands) and 63rd (Croatia) of 
the 141 countries analysed. The EU is quite diverse in its competitiveness levels, even more when looking at the 
subnational level with mainly metropolitan regions per-
forming better367, such as Utrecht (in the Netherlands), 
or Hovestaden (Copenhagen region) than elsewhere in 
the country. In the WEF analysis, China places 28th in the 
ranking368, the best performer of the BRICS countries. 
The other strongly growing emerging economies rank 
in place 50 for Indonesia and 68 for India. Despite the 
well-ranked position of the EU currently, its long-term 
high-ranking is in peril369. 
China’s economic strategy is challenging Europe-
an competitiveness. The strong links between the EU 
and Chinese value chains and trade relationships are 
undergoing a transformation. China is trying to be more 
self-reliant in its domestic market, and is reducing its 
openness to foreign economies, in accordance with 
the ‘internal circulation’ element of its ‘dual circulation 
strategy’370. The Chinese market should become a fu-
ture growth driver for its domestic industry, as China is 
expected to achieve a high-income country status by 
2025371. Therefore, China is aiming to reduce the ex-
port-dependence of its economy372. The role of China as 
the EU’s second biggest export market risks diminishing. 
EU industries that have built their strength on exports 
to China will be particularly affected, such as machin-
ery and equipment, motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals 
industries373. The EU economy will get more competition 
from the ‘Made in China 2025’ vision and further up-
dates. 
China is aiming to become a leading global su-
perpower by 2049374. Competition with China is also 
increasing in other world regions where European indus-
try is active. For example in Africa, Chinese players have Figure 14: Economic weight of EU27, G7 and E7 in share of global GDP (at current prices)361

45become by far the biggest infrastructure builders in the 
last decade, while European players lost ground. The 
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is being used as a lever for 
exporting construction of infrastructures. Chinese devel-
opment banks and BRI funds are backing Chinese indus-
try’s tenders375. Chinese actors are increasingly active in 
EU and Member States tenders for infrastructure too376, 
while access to Chinese market is heavily regulated and 
relatively closed377. The EU is losing economic influence 
through these one-sided dependencies. 
The US and China are outpacing Europe in some emerg-
ing growth areas. In the last decade, a range of innova-
tions such as 5G, AI, cloud computing and the IoTs, have 
become major strategic assets for the EU economy. With 
the global market for new digital technologies expected 
to reach €2.2 trillion by 2025, a large part of Europe’s 
growth potential resides in this digital market378. How -
ever, the EU risks lagging behind in some areas, such as 
genomics, quantum computing, or AI379 380. 
Demographic change is further challenging Euro-
pean competitiveness. The working age population 
will have shrunk by about 16% in Europe and 17% in 
China381 by 2050, compared to 2020382, while in North 
America and in India, it is growing. A shrinking working 
age population results in a lack of workforce that make 
it challenging to maintain robust economic growth and 
this will affect the global importance of the economy 
and its competitiveness. As well as the reduced work-
force, an ageing population will lead to the economic 
challenges of financing the social system, in particular 
increasing pensions and health costs383. 
Keeping a high level of competitiveness enables 
Europe open strategic autonomy. A competitive glob-
al market helps to avoid one-sided economic dependen-
cies, as countries can diversify supply chains and rely on 
quality products and services from elsewhere. It offers 
the baseline to create welfare and government revenues 
that reduce dependencies on creditors. Dynamic innova-
tion capabilities provide the competence to develop tech-
nologies, processes, products and services and to be less 
dependent on foreign innovation providers to advance the 
economy. Being open, means that the economy relies on 
global value networks, it produces, creates and innovates 
in collaboration with foreign actors, and provides goods, 
services and approaches to global markets. Several sig-
nals indicate that Europe has to invest more in its own 
economic, research and innovation capabilities, its labour 
market and its education system in order to avoid being 
taken over by emerging economies. Global debt
The world is in a global debt wave, which has cre-
ated dependencies on creditors. The COVID-19 pan-
demic hit the world when it was still in a “global wave 
of debt”, where it has been since 2010. Global debt 
has grown mainly in emerging markets and developing 
economies to reach an all-time high of 230% of GDP in 
2018. The dimension of debt build-up in term of size, 
speed and reach of the debt, and in this wave, is signifi-
cantly larger compared to previous ones, at the same 
time as economic growth prospects are low384. 
The pandemic required huge government spend-
ing. It has added EUR 20 trillion global debt, during a 
phase of sharp economic contraction385. This has raised 
the vulnerability of the global economy to financial 
market stress386. Some economies are getting close to 
dangerous levels387. Fiscal sustainability risks limit a 
country’s ability to act. Public spending might need cuts. 
This will reduce capability to invest in health, education 
and infrastructure. Digitalisation and ‘greening of the 
economy’ relies upon the market. But if dependency on 
creditors is huge, it limits open strategic autonomy. An 
upcoming financial crisis, resulting from this global debt 
wave could mean the harsh disruption of global econ-
omies, turning the current economic interdependencies 
upside down. 
China is the world’s largest creditor, potentially 
influencing debtor’s policies. China is one of the top 
lenders to the US and the largest lender to emerging 
economies.388 China is investing in infrastructure con-
struction in line with their Belt and Road Initiative be-
tween Asia and Europe, such as ports e.g. in Pakistan, 
Djibouti, Piraeus/Greece, and railroads including Buda-
pest-Belgrade railway389. The projects are mostly fi-
nanced via China’s own funds, state-owned banks and 
the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Lending con-
ditions for projects mainly in Africa and Latin Ameri-
ca390 are being criticised due to their potential to lead to 
a debt trap and political dependencies. There is a lack 
of transparency due to confidentially clauses. Chinese 
lenders seek advantages over other creditors, limit-
ing collective restructuring of debt, and with contract 
clauses potentially allow lenders to influence debtor’s 
domestic and foreign policies391. Some projects have led 
to project standstill, or financial instability, also in close 
proximity to Europe, such as the Montenegro highway 
project392 or the Budapest-Belgrade railway. China’s 
credits are creating financial dependencies in Europe’s 
neighbourhood and even inside the EU.
46
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDInternational role of the euro 
The role of the euro in global trade is second 
globally, but far behind the US dollar. From 1945 
to today, the US dollar has been the world’s most ma-
jor currency, with approximately a 60% share of for-
eign exchange reserves. The euro is the second largest 
currency with a 19% share. The share of global pay-
ments in euro amounted to around 36%, following the 
US dollar with 39% in April 2021393. Overall, the euro’s 
international role has remained stable in 2020, but it is 
at a low level394. Stability in times of a global health and 
economic crises and exceptional policy support is a sign 
of its resilience. 
The euro has a strong regional reach and in eu-
ro-area trade. But it is far from challenging the domi-
nance of the US dollar395. “The monetary autonomy that 
comes with an international currency helps to provide a 
buffer against political or military pressures from out-
side, and the greater the monetary dependence of third 
countries, the wider the choice of policy instruments, in-
cluding the possibility of exploiting access to financial 
and payments systems”396.
The European Central Bank provided monetary 
policy measures during the COVID-19 crisis. This 
contributed to ensure credit supply and to stabilise the 
euro area economy. It included provisioning of liquidity to 
non-euro area central banks. Stabilising the euro in times 
of crises supports its international status. The non-euro 
area intervention offered access to its currency at the in-
ternational level. It contributes to increasing confidence 
in euro asset markets. National fiscal policies, EU level 
instruments, and ECB monetary policy have shown their 
capability to enhance the resilience of the euro area in 
times of large shock and as a side effect have strength-
ened the international role of the euro397. 
A greater international use of the euro will in-
crease the EU’s economic open strategic auton-
omy. To increase its importance398, the euro needs to 
become the standard currency for payments and invest-
ments in more areas, both as a reserve currency and as 
the denomination of state and corporate bonds. With 
trade in commodity markets being strategically carried 
out in euro, progress is visible399. The Commission’s Next 
Generation EU instruments use safe euro area assets400 
through debt issues. This large EU bond issuance of up 
to euro 800 million by the European Commission pro-
vides highest creditor status. It raises the attractiveness of the euro as an investment currency for internation-
al investors compared to single Member State’s bond 
markets. A well-designed common European safe as-
set could enhance financial integration and stability for 
states borrowing and investors lending money. European 
safe assets could support the international role of the 
euro401. However, for the euro to become a ‘crisis-proof’ 
leading currency, the political will of Member States is 
needed to further deepen the Capital Markets Union402. 
The rapid development of private and public dig-
ital currencies could be a game changer. In this 
context, Central Bank Digital Currencies are considered 
to be the natural next step in the digitization of money 
and payment systems and a global race to define the 
world’s reserve currency of the digital era has started403. 
China is the frontrunner in experimenting with and ap-
plying digital currency404. The Central bank money of-
fered in digital form for retail payments of citizens and 
businesses does not alter the fundamental economics 
of global currencies, but can impact their international 
role405. The European Central Bank launched a project to 
prepare a possible issuance of digital euros that could 
facilitate payments efficiency and security across the 
eurozone406. If a similar digital euro would not be pro-
vided, other digital currencies, such as China’s renminbi 
or the US dollar would step in and expand their interna-
tional role. Beside other countries issuing digital money, 
also global tech companies could step in with their plat-
forms, while central banks loosing influence in the fi-
nancial market407. Therefore, an ECB-issued digital euro 
could futureproof the euro against these developments. 
The EU has the capability to cope with a more 
fragmented global monetary and financial sys-
tem. Having the second largest currency globally, the 
EU could build capabilities to play a stronger role in a 
less US dollar-dominated world. The EU would need to 
advance in several areas, such as a: 
• stronger integration of the Banking and Capital 
Markets Union; 
• widening of instruments first applied in the 
COVID-19 crisis with euro-area safe assets; 
• intensifying non-euro area central bank exchanges; and 
• updating the objectives and tasks of established 
financial institutions and instruments, such as the 
European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European 
Stability Mechanism (ESM). 
47The introduction of a digital euro would be an ad-
ditional asset to incentivise currency substitution. 
All of these could be the basis to develop a European 
financial system to complement institutions of the cur-
rent global financial architecture408. 
Beyond the stronger role of the euro, completing 
the Single Market means strengthening Europe’s 
foundation for wealth and regulatory power. The 
Single Market offers the scale for European companies 
to grow and become more competitive in the interna-
tional market. It could be further used to mobilise in-
vestments in research and innovation,409 as well as to 
raise venture capital for start-ups to push disruptive 
technologies, and business models to improve the fu-
ture competitiveness of industry. The single market for 
data is critical for the European data economy’s scale, 
and depends on secure digital connectivity infrastruc-
ture410. 
Economic impact of the digital transition
Digitalisation is transforming Europe’s industry, 
as well as the areas already covered within this 
report in the Technology and Geopolitics sections. 
There are also different dimensions of digitalisation 
of EU industry: digital processes, such as Industry 4.0 
and 5.0, can drive efficiency of production and services. 
They are an enabler for the circular economy, reducing 
emissions and improving a sustainable economy. Digital 
business models enable new forms of value creation, 
innovative ways of delivering products and services. 
Both dimensions require enabling technologies like AI 
and digital infrastructures from 5G, cloud computing to 
quantum computing. Europe’s economy is challenged by 
competition from big powers in digital technology and 
security standards, mainly from US and Chinese actors 
(such as the 5G Huawei procurement debate)411. To bal-
ance the interdependence of European industry in the 
digital transition with foreign actors, the EU needs to 
further intensify its activities in smart regulation and 
investment, as well as its collaboration with foreign dig-
ital actors.
Economic impact of climate crises and green 
transition 
Climate change impacts will incur substantial 
economic costs. Without profound and system-wide 
changes in consumption and production patterns, it will 
not be possible to support the 10 billion people expect-
ed to inhabit the earth by 2050412. The costs of climate change in a 3.2°C climate world would cause an ac-
cumulated economic loss equivalent to 18% of global 
GDP by 2050, if compared to a world without climate 
change. While Europe and North America would be less 
negatively affected (9.5-10.5% of GDP), Asian countries 
would face a much more devastating effect (ASEAN 
countries: 37.4%).413 Regarding Europe, annual welfare 
losses of € 175 billion or 1.4% of GDP can be expected 
if global warming reaches 3°C.414
The Green Transition requires substantial invest-
ments that would lead to a modernisation of the 
EU’s economy. To reach a climate neutral society by 
2050, all sectors need significant changes in how they 
operate. The ‘Green Transition’ would require annual 
investments of EUR 1 trillion in the EU, 80% of which 
shifts from carbon intensive to low carbon investments, 
and 20% additional spending that would be offset by 
savings415. This investment would lead to a fundamen-
tal revamp of many industrial sectors and would in-
crease the innovation rate of the economy. There is an 
increasing recognition that such an investment strategy 
would not only reduce environmental impacts, but also 
make the economy more resilient.416
The smooth transfer of labour from declining to 
growing sectors in a green transition will be es-
sential to realise economic growth opportunities. 
The green transitions will have an unequal impact on 
different economic sectors (and regions across the EU). 
Fossil fuel sectors and/or those depending on them (e.g. 
technology providers to the refining industry) will con-
tract. New jobs will be created in clean energy, energy 
efficiency and circular economy sectors.417 The transfer 
of people from declining to growing sectors will be a 
major challenge, as regional mobility and skill availabil-
ity are limiting factors that could lead to a shortage of 
workforce and therefore could prevent growth in green 
sectors.418
Successful management of the green transition 
would help to increase the EU’s open strategic au-
tonomy. Establishing a resource efficient and circular 
economy could reduce the impact of strict climate poli-
cies of foreign countries and reduce one-sided resource 
interdependencies without generating extra tensions on 
one’s own economy. It could even further contribute to 
higher competitiveness and technology leadership.

The EU is strong in leveraging the advantages of the green transition. Europe wields considerable 
influence and traction in international fora to advance its global change agenda and mitigate threats linked to 
depleted global commons. It has the most advanced legal framework to achieve the green transition. It has 
also developed a comprehensive strategy to adapt to climate change. The EU has already increased the share 
of renewable energy in its energy mix, decreasing its energy import dependence, and has set a framework for 
sustainable food production. On the other hand, its energy-intensive industries will still have to reduce green-
house gas emissions substantially to reach climate neutrality. Strict environmental regulation could put these 
industries at a disadvantage, as they have to compete globally.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDCurrent strengths and weaknesses
Climate diplomacy
The EU leads in climate championing and di-
plomacy globally. The EU and its Member States 
have established themselves early as climate diplo-
macy leaders. They were instrumental in setting up 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change.419 More recently, the EU and its Member 
States have played a crucial role in securing the Paris 
Agreement. The EU continues to play this role today 
and is currently setting the standard and pace for 
other global powers. For example, it was the first re-
gion to commit to achieving climate neutrality, which 
has led to more and more other countries and regions 
pledging to become climate neutral.
Championing the green transition
The EU provides planning security for the green 
transition. The success of climate change mitiga-
tion and adaptation depends on public and private 
buy-in of policies and strategies. The European Com-
mission’s proposed Climate Target Plan aims at am-
bitious greenhouse gas emissions cuts – amounting 
to 55% less of current emissions – by 2030, and the European Green Deal proposes climate neutrality by 
2050420. The Climate Target Plan was backed up by a 
far-reaching package of proposals aimed to achieve 
the new climate target.421 It is very comprehensive 
and it will have profound effects on economic and 
political relationships, industries and lifestyles. With 
its long-term climate and environmental plans, the 
EU provides all stakeholders certainty, which makes it 
easier for everyone to plan for the climate transition.
The EU has substantially increased the share of 
renewable energy in its energy mix. The EU has 
legally binding long-term targets for renewable en-
ergy and energy efficiency and a comprehensive reg-
ulatory framework to monitor compliance with these 
targets.422 These have led to a doubling of the share 
of renewable energy in the EU between 2004 and 
2019.423 The European Green Deal further stresses 
the importance of renewable energy and energy effi-
ciency to become climate neutral in 2050. Reaching 
this goal would reduce the EU’s energy import depen-
dency from 54% in 2018 to 20% in 2050.424 
The EU has a comprehensive strategy to secure 
sustainable food production. While the EU has a 
food trade surplus,425 it does rely on other countries Figure 15. Innovation in environment-related technologies, technology development

51to supplement its food supply. Recent crises have re-
vealed the strong interlinkages between health, eco-
systems, food supply chains, consumption patterns 
and planetary boundaries. The Commission’s Farm to 
Fork Strategy commits to building a robust and resil-
ient food system that functions in all circumstances.426.
Green technology leadership
The EU leads in a few ‘green technology’ cate-
gories. The EU is technology leader when it comes 
to offshore wind and is positioning itself strongly in 
other emerging green technology areas, such as re-
newable hydrogen and electric vehicles. Of the grant-
ed patents in several green technology segments, the 
EU is ahead of the US, Japan and China.
New key players are challenging the EU’s tech-
nology leadership. While Europe had an early mar-
ket lead in solar photovoltaic panels, China has been 
able to catch up in some areas. Despite relatively few 
patents, China leads in lithium-ion battery produc-
tion,427 and has by far the highest installed capacity 
of renewable energy power generation.428 It currently 
produces over 70% of the world’s photovoltaic cells 
and half of the world electric vehicles, and it controls 
the supply chains of some critical raw materials429. 
This makes other regions vulnerable to a decrease in 
exports from China.
Reducing vulnerability to climate change
The EU has made some progress in reducing its 
vulnerability to the negative effects of climate 
change. Resilience concerns extend to flooding of 
coastal economies and infrastructures, the increase 
of extreme weather events such as droughts on econ-
omies,430 and the spread of infectious diseases431. 
With the proposed EU Strategy on Adaptation to Cli-
mate Change432, the European Commission aims to 
strengthen its preparedness for the increasing fre-
quency of extreme weather events and other climate 
change-related challenges, which lie ahead.
Future opportunities and challenges
The EU’s open strategic autonomy is set to ben-
efit from the green transition. The growing stress 
on natural resources globally and the increasing im-
pacts of climate change are threats to the EU. Accel-
erating the green transition is an important way to 
mitigate this issue and reduce potential future harm. 
The energy transition could reduce import dependen-cy on fossil fuels, while the effective implementation 
of a circular economy could reduce the need to im-
port critical raw materials, or other goods. When it 
comes to energy-intensive industries, there is the risk 
of reducing the competitiveness of EU companies, by 
implementing stricter environmental standards than 
other regions that serve the same global market.
Growing stress on the Earth’s natural resources
The increasing population and growing con-
sumerism is leading to growing resource con-
sumption. The expected global population increase 
from 7.7bn people in 2019 to 8.6bn in 2030433 will 
result in an increase of 50% in food demand and a 
40% increase in energy demand as the middle class 
grows434. In addition, by 2030 the global middle class 
will substantially increase, mostly in Asia (e.g. 70% of 
the population in China is expected to be middle class 
by 2030)435. Increased purchasing power and income 
levels often come with increased food, water and en-
ergy demands, as well as increased consumerism.
Resource stress is set to increase dramatically. 
A growing and wealthier population will put further 
strain on the scarce resources available on Earth and 
cause further environmental degradation to keep up 
with growing consumption patterns. Increased con-
sumption translates into the loss of natural habitat 
and increased waste and pollution levels in water, soil 
and air, all of which threatens biodiversity, health and 
increases the environmental footprint.436 Weak glob-
al governance on the ‘global commons’ such as the 
shared deep sea, Arctic etc., make it difficult to reduce 
environmental impacts in these ecosystems.437
Europe wields 
considerable influence 
and traction in 
international fora to 
advance its global 
change agenda and 
mitigate threats 
linked to depleted 
global commons
52
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDDeclining biodiversity is a threat to European 
ecosystems. The reduction in number or the extinc-
tion of species caused by humans has accelerated in 
recent years. Some of the reasons are changes in land 
use, pollution and human-induced climate change.438 
There is the possibility in ecosystems that the loss of 
one species triggers a domino effect of extinctions 
of other species.439 A further future risk is posed by 
the reduction in pollinators in the EU,440 as more than 
three quarters of our food crops depend on them.441
Increasing impacts of climate change
The tangible impacts of climate change are in-
creasing. While Europe is not the most affected re-
gion in the world, negative effects such as flooding 
or wildfires could affect the EU and its economy will 
increase. On a global scale, the climate crisis is ex-
pected to cause substantial economic damage.442 The 
increase of climate change effects could be acceler-
ated by reaching and surpassing tipping points, such 
as the loss of the Antarctic ice sheet, which would 
catalyse further global warming.443
Rising temperatures will severely affect water 
and food availability. In the next decade, the MENA region444 will be particularly hard hit, as it faces in-
creasing pressure on water availability and crop pro-
duction445. These developments could cause disruptive 
long-distance migration flows that will also affect the 
EU. However, there is also the more systematic risk 
of global food shortages. As the food supply is glob-
al, disruptions in one food producing region can have 
knock-on effects on others. Even more severe would 
be crop failures in many of the main food-producing 
regions, which is referred to as ‘multiple breadbasket 
failure’.446
Increasing climate change pressure might lead 
to risky unilateral attempts to ‘solve’ the cli-
mate crisis. The increasingly negative impacts of 
climate change could lead to unilateral attempts to 
accelerate climate action. Particularly the use of geo-
engineering (e.g. ocean iron fertilization), which is the 
manipulation of the climate on a large scale, is highly 
contested.447 Such an attempt would infer substantial 
environmental risks because the impact of geoengi-
neering are not yet sufficiently researched.448 Geoen-
gineering also poses a moral hazard, as climate ac-
tion might be postponed which would simply shift the 
problem to subsequent generations.449Figure 16. Share of renewable energy in the EU

53Accelerating energy transition
The energy transition is expected to accelerate 
globally and lead to a transformation of the 
world’s energy mix. The accelerating transition is the 
product of technological innovation, of the rapidly fall-
ing price of renewable energy and of legislative and 
societal choices across the world, motivated by the 
pressing need to mitigate climate change. Considering 
that energy production and consumption account for 
about 75% of greenhouse gas emissions,450 substitut-
ing fossil fuels by sustainable alternatives is a crucial 
requirement to keep the rise of global temperatures 
within two degrees above pre-industrial levels. If the 
EU reaches its goal of climate neutrality by 2050, it 
would reduce its energy import dependency from 54% 
in 2018 to 20% in 2050 at the same time.451
Electrification, the substitution of fossil fuels, 
and renewable energy enable the energy transi-
tion. These include the progressive electrification of 
the economy and the provision of green hydrogen to 
operate those sectors that cannot rely on electricity, 
such as aviation. The shift “from carbon to electron” 
will therefore be at the core of the transition452. With 
a view to meeting current commitments under the 
Paris Agreements, electricity should provide 50% of 
the energy needs by 2050, up from 20% today453. 
Worldwide, according to the International Energy 
Agency, renewables will overtake coal as the larg-
est source of power generation by 2025 already.454 
Those countries that have technological knowledge in 
the relevant areas are set to benefit from the energy 
transition.
Implementing a Circular Economy
The Circular Economy can reduce import depen-
dencies. Resource efficiency is a key component of 
the Commission’s European Green Deal, which aims 
to achieve a sustainable and carbon-neutral econom-
ic system. To meet this aim, the circular economy455 
action plan has been developed to keep resource con-
sumption within planetary boundaries and reduce im-
port dependence on raw materials, or other resourc-
es. The circular economy aims to reuse and recycle 
products and other resources, reducing the need for 
new resources, reducing waste and pollution and en-
suring a well-functioning internal market for high 
quality second hand raw materials.456 This is a key 
building block of a sustainable product policy frame-
work, in which consumers are also empowered with cost-saving opportunities through repair possibilities, 
or product maintenance services, and trustworthy in-
formation on the real environmental footprint of the 
products they want to purchase.
Decarbonising energy-intensive industries
The industrial sector is a vital backbone of 
modern economies but is a major emitter of 
greenhouse gases and pollutants to air, water, 
and soil. Particularly energy-intensive industries are 
those that produce crucial materials such as steel, 
cement, and chemicals.457 While they are used in sev-
eral products, they also play an even bigger role in the 
context of the green transition, as several decarboni-
sation enablers, such as wind turbines or PV installa-
tions require energy-intensive raw materials too.458 
However, the industrial sector emits large quantities 
of greenhouse gases and contributed to 20% of EU 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. Globally industry 
is responsible for approximately 50% of global green 
house gas emission.459
Technology options to decarbonise energy-in-
tensive industries already exist. Europe’s energy 
intensive industry is operating established, older in-
frastructure and therefore is more carbon intensive 
than the more modern Asian operators are.460 Howev-
er, the EU has an advanced research and innovation 
roadmap to decarbonise.461 Decarbonisation options 
to bring industry emissions close to zero include a 
mix of: i) energy efficiency improvements; ii) electri-
fication of heat; iii) replacing fossil feedstock by sus-
tainable alternatives; and iv) applying carbon capture 
and storage.462
Decarbonising energy-intensive sectors could 
lead to a disadvantage. As the EU has already es-
tablished infrastructure for these sectors, decarboni-
sation entails the retrofitting of existing plants. Such 
a ‘brownfields conversion’ increases the already sub-
stantial investment requirements in these sectors.463 
As many of the products produced are global com-
modities, EU manufactures compete at a global level. 
Green EU manufacturers might have a disadvantage 
if they have higher production costs than internation-
al competition due to the higher EU environmental 
standards. This might lead to the relocation of ener-
gy-intensive production plants to locations with less 
strict environmental standards, a phenomenon also 
referred to as ‘carbon leakage’.464

SOCIETY
55Society 
Open strategic autonomy is only possible if the EU preserves its commitment to the respect of 
the rule of law and other fundamental values. An open society is also required, while achieving greater 
cohesion in society and having human resources and capital to sustain it. Despite its relevance, social aspects 
of open strategic autonomy are significantly less explored in EU policy documents to date. 
Public policies have the goal of changing society and the economy, while creating public value465. 
The EU is active in shaping a society of equal opportunities.  EU policies in general  are based on the principle 
of intergenerational justice, solidarity, human dignity. People are the cornerstone of any successful attempt 
to achieve open strategic autonomy. An open society helps to not only engage and bring together European 
citizens but also develop collaborations with others and attract foreign talent.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDCurrent strengths and weaknesses
High standards of fundamental rights 
The EU is founded on the values of respect for 
human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the 
rule of law and respect for human rights, includ-
ing the rights of persons belonging to minority 
groups466. The EU has been committed to underpin 
these values in all of the EU’s internal and external poli-
cies467. Despite negative trends in this area, recently seen 
in some Member States, the EU has remained resolute in 
defending human rights and democracy, and has com-
mitted to further advancing universal values for all. 
This is particularly important nowadays when a 
global decline of democracy has been perceived 
worldwide. According to the Freedom House468, dem-
ocratic systems around the world were negatively im-
pacted by COVID-19 crisis. Excessive surveillance, as 
well as restrictions on some human rights (such as the 
freedom of movement and assembly and freedom of 
expression), together with lack of transparency for gov-
ernmental decisions, were noticed around the world. In 
autocratic regimes in particular, they were often dispro-
portionate to the threats posed by the virus. Misinfor-
mation and disinformation about COVID-19 virus, treat-
ments and vaccines, have spread quickly through online 
public sphere to advance political aims by undermining 
trust in the EU while jeopardizing lives469.
The European Commission’s Action Plan on Human 
Rights and Democracy is the only instrument of 
its kind aimed at promoting a values-based agen-
da on the world stage470. This and similar policy ini-
tiatives can build more resilient, inclusive and demo-
cratic societies in the EU. They can also strengthen the 
EU’s global leadership in protecting and empowering 
individuals. Through the Action Plan, the EU will be able 
to promote a global system for human rights and de-
mocracy, gender equality and strengthened civil society.
 A new strategy to strengthen the use of the EU 
Charter of Fundamental Rights has recently been 
adopted471. The strategy472 focuses on enhancing the 
application of the Charter in Member States through 
enhancing partnerships between the Commission and 
Member States. It will strengthen citizens’ awareness 
(a  Eurobarometer survey from 2019 showed that only 
12% really know what the Charter is, while 42% have 
‘heard about it’473) and empower civil society and prac-
titioners through taking actions against measures that breach EU law. The Strategy’s intention is to have the 
Charter serve as a compass for EU institutions whose 
actions all need to comply with it.
Reduction of inequalities 
Reducing inequalities and improving living condi-
tions is high on the policy agenda for the Europe-
an Union institutions. Inequalities are often seen in 
connection to gender, age, disability, sexuality, employ-
ment status, skin colour, or citizenship. These have very 
real implications for salaries, access to jobs, welfare, 
health, education, services, personal safety and other 
rights that are often taken for granted.474 Racial, eth-
nic, and gender inequalities became more pronounced 
during COVID-19 pandemics in countries around the 
world475.
The European Pillar of Social Rights aims to tackle 
inequalities in key areas and thereby to strength-
en the European Social Model. While reflecting the 
Union’s founding principles, social policy aims to reduce 
inequality, maximise job creation and allow Europe’s 
people, its human capital to thrive. 
The Pillar sets out 20 key principles and rights 
that are essential for fair and well-functioning 
labour markets and welfare systems in the fu-
ture. The Pillar is structured around three chapters: 
• Equal opportunities and access to the labour market; 
• Fair working conditions; 
• Social protection and inclusion. 
The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan also 
proposes targets for employment, skills and social in-
clusion at EU-level that are to be achieved by 2030. 
By providing harmonised measures of various 
social progress indicators, the European Social 
Scoreboard476 facilitates monitoring of the im-
plementation of the Pillar. This is achieved through 
comparing Member States areas of strengths and 
weaknesses in the social domain. By closely monitor-
ing key socioeconomic and environmental indicators, 
the Scoreboard provides an important tool for adopting 
tailored policy initiatives in a coordinated manner and 
is key for monitoring. How these aspirations will trans-
late to legislation, and legislation to impact on society, 
is also crucial.

Besides the Pillar, several key equality strategies 
have been adopted since 2020. These are: 
• the EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclu-
sion and participation for 2020- 2030; 
• Gender Equality Strategy, 2020-2025;
• the LGBTIQ equality strategy 2020-2025;
• the EU Anti-racism action plan 2020-2025;
• the Strategy on the rights of persons with disabilities 
2021-2030.
The Gender Equality Strategy, for example, brings 
forward a vision of gender equality that is free 
from violence and stereotypes and has equal op-
portunities. This is connected to other actions to ensure 
equal participation of girls and women in ICT studies and 
developing their digital skills as announced in the 2020 
Digital Education Action Plan and the European Skills 
Agenda. Also, the European Pillar of Social Rights puts 
gender equality at its core with ambitious targets for 
women’s participation in the labour market and the pro-
vision of early childhood education and care (particularly 
important for working mothers). All of these initiatives 
contribute to a stronger cohesion in EU society that are 
important for achieving open strategic autonomy.
Skills availability
The EU has solid education systems. Despite this, 
continued advancements in education and training are 
necessary to ensure the personal and professional de-velopment of citizens and to guarantee a match between 
education and the future job market. Ensuring high qual-
ity and widespread access to education is one of the 
drivers of economic growth, social cohesion and research 
and innovation478. Alongside education, a substantial in-
vestment in skills is needed to support future jobs, critical 
sectors and emerging technologies479, which will be key 
to supporting the EU’s open strategic autonomy. A target 
of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan is to 
have 80% of EU population having at least basic digital 
skills by 2030480.
The EU’s excellence in education helps to attract 
and retain global talent. The Digital Education Plan 
(2021-2027)481 offers a vision of high quality, inclusive 
and accessible digital education in the EU and proposes 
to equip young people with cutting-edge skills and ex-
pertise. EU education and training exchange programmes 
(ERASMUS and ERASMUS MUNDI) expose young people 
from the EU, as well as people worldwide, to multicultural 
learning. 
The EU’s technological strength depends on the 
scale and quality of Member State capacities and 
competencies in critical technologies and sectors. 
According to the Digital Economy and Society Index 
(DESI)482, the EU has a shortage of digital experts for 
developing cutting-edge technologies and 70% of firms 
lack adequate in-house digital skills. This requires sub-
stantial investment in human capital development483. For 
the moment, the US is leading with the highest number 
of programmes offered in the technological domains of 
AI, High Performance Computing, as well as more general 
58
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDcomputer and data science courses. The next two most 
relevant geographical areas are the EU and the UK (with 
regards to having many programmes offered)484.
In the area of AI, there is a small gap between 
the EU, UK and US in the offer of Masters pro-
grammes. Despite its world-leading universities and 
research institutions, the EU does not educate enough 
data scientists, programmers or business translators to 
ensure sufficient scale and depth for AI integration in 
commercial use485. While an increased demand exists 
in Europe, the offer (i.e. the number of Masters cours-
es on offer) is not adequate (Figure 15). The EU needs 
to increase the offer of first degrees, Master and PhD 
progammes and to attract more international talent. 
Closing the gender gap and ensuring the inclusion of 
women is also an important aspect to address in the 
area of digital technologies (as well as STEM in general) 
in order to avoid gender biases and increase the num-
bers of skilled workforce. 
Investment in skills will remain an important 
component for the EU’s open strategic auton-
omy. The European Skills Agenda and the initiatives 
such as Pact for Skills, support the green and digital 
transition through upskilling and reskilling the work-
force in the EU and skills partnerships. Estimations 
foresee that the EU and Member States would need 
to invest €42 billion per year to educate, upskill, and 
reskill the labour force in order to manage the digital 
transition. This is important, as 90% of new jobs will 
require digital skills486.
Future opportunities and challenges
Increasing demographic imbalances
Demographic projections suggest that the world’s 
population could reach nearly 10 billion people by 
2050487. Despite a general convergence towards demo-
graphic profiles characterised by low fertility and longer 
life expectancy, the inertia of demographic processes 
will cause profound demographic imbalances between 
high- and low-income countries in the coming decades. 
On one side, in high-income countries, low fertility 
rates488 are resulting in the rapid ageing of the popula-
tion and the shrinking of the labour force. On the other, 
low-income countries with high fertility levels,489 will ex-
perience an expanding total population with high shares 
of young adults in their populations. These demographic 
imbalances in terms of redistribution of total population 
and age structure are unprecedented in human history. They will play a key role in future geopolitical, economic 
and political positioning of countries worldwide, in the 
decades to come.
The already existing demographic imbalances 
mean that the EU’s geopolitical and economic 
weight could fade. This is related not only to the de-
cline in the sheer number of people in the EU compared 
to increases in the global south, but also to the size 
of the labour force and level of productivity, due to an 
ageing population. Besides this, there are other dispar-
ities and dynamics that need to be factored in, such as 
education and skills of the people490 that further im-
pact innovation capacity. This explains the differences 
in terms of economic growth between countries across 
the Global North and the Global South, and will also be 
key for the future. 
Demographic change will affect the EU’s position 
in the world, its geopolitical strategy491 and will 
create a need for the EU to be united, stronger 
and more strategic492. At a lower geographical level 
within the EU, large internal movements and residential 
preferences will continue to reshape demographic struc-
tures across regions and will and increase differences493.
Demographic challenges place a strain on the sus-
tainability of EU social protection systems. In the 
EU, ageing and declining birth rates have direct conse-
quences for economic growth, demand for goods and 
services, as well as health and elderly care. While there 
are regional differences within countries, the old-age-de-
pendency ratio in the EU has been increasing in recent 
decades, reaching about 1:3 in 2019, on average494. 
The EU will need to ensure that living longer at 
an individual level turns into an asset at the mac-
ro-level. Welfare systems need to remain sustainable; 
despite the shrinking labour force and ensure that internal 
demographic territorial differences and increased mobility 
do not lead to polarisation and lack of internal cohesion.
EU health and care systems will have to adapt 
further. Higher amounts of age-related public 
spending will be needed.495 The EU4Health (2021-
2027)496 programme has committed to boosting the 
EU’s preparedness for major cross border health threats, 
strengthening health systems to face large scale epi-
demics and other long-term challenges, as well as to 
making medicines and medical services available and 
affordable for everyone. 
59The ageing process in the EU is associated with 
residential patterns that may result in an unbal-
anced mix of generations in the future. If individ-
uals’ social networks become increasingly homogenous 
along age and territorial lines, it will remove opportuni-
ties to experience intergenerational interactions and to 
get in contact with a variety of political views and issues. 
These dynamics may negatively affect social cohesion 
and nurture polarisations in the future population, with 
serious implications for the stability of the EU497.
Greater importance needs to be given to securing 
talent. In an ageing society, attracting and maintaining 
talent becomes increasingly important. Well integrated 
migrant workers are key for keeping the economy going. 
Higher shares of female labour market participations 
could also increase the availability of talent. Lastly, se-
curing the continued engagement of more mature citi-
zens in the labour markets will be important considering 
they will constitute a growing share of the population.
Increasing polarisation
Increasing polarisation in society poses a risk for 
our democratic systems and institutions, as well as the stability of internal affairs and internation-
al relations. Polarisation in society means the state or 
process of increasing divergence of people’s attitudes 
towards ideological extremes498 and leads to dissatis-
faction and deep divisions in society. It is partly driven 
by social media rise and the disruption of traditional 
media industry. It influences personal interactions and 
everyday life, as well as for example, judiciary systems, 
media or civil society (with attacks on courts, journalists 
and activists, considering them as biased)499.
Almost all EU societies have become more pola-
rised since 2000, on almost all key political is-
sues500.  Figure 17 shows the increase of polarisation in 
several EU Member States, confirming the general ten-
dency.  Polarisation impacts negatively social cohesion 
and could cause political instabilities that might create 
obstacles for the implementation of open strategic au-
tonomy policies. 
Together with polarisation, disinformation, misin-
formation and conspiracy theories seem to have 
increased in recent years. Although for some schol-
ars it is questionable how much disinformation influenc-
es political beliefs and increases political polarisation, Figure 18: Share of the population in the world population (x-axis) by the share of the youth, in se-
lected countries and regions, 2020, 2050 and 2100, United Nations medium variant.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDthe two phenomena seem to reinforce each other. 501
Populism is another phenomenon directly fuelling 
polarisation. The traditional division between right and 
left wing parties has been increasingly replaced by a 
new division between establishment and anti-establish-
ment parties. Populism tries to establish close relation-
ship with the population and distance itself from the 
establishment, thus creating new divisions in society 
(“pure people” vs “corrupt elites”)502. 
Given the present trends, growing polarisation, 
expansion of populism and disinformation are 
likely to continue to exist in the future, but their 
scale will remain uncertain. The national recovery 
plans supported by the EU need to tackle pre-existing 
inequality challenges, along with the detrimental effects 
brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, to promote and 
ensure long-term social and economic resilience.
Citizen engagement with policymaking
Better inclusion of citizens in policymaking could 
increase the EU’s democratic legitimacy and make social cohesion stronger503. Engaging citizens in pol-
icymaking processes ensures that public policies are in 
the public interest. By co-designing them with citizens, 
reliability and validity of policies can greatly improve .
Giving more direct power to citizens could con-
tribute to the better functioning of European 
democracies, increased social capital and trust 
in political processes504. This can be done through 
diverse forms of citizen engagement such as citizen 
assemblies, deliberative polls or juries. Citizen engage-
ment is one of the key pillars of open and transparent 
government. Successful examples in the EU have been 
seen recently at local and regional, as well as national 
levels of governance. EU Member States such as Ire-
land, Estonia, Luxembourg and Romania have employed 
deliberative methods to review their constitutions505. For 
example, citizens’ assembly were organised in Ireland 
(2016-2018) that discussed and made recommenda-
tions for several constitutional questions, including cli-
mate change, the abortion referendum, gender equality 
and ageing population questions506.Figure 19: Polarisation of society in Europe

61Citizen-led debates and discussions on policy is-
sues could enable people from across the EU to 
share their ideas and help shape the common fu-
ture. The European Commission’s initiative ‘Conference 
on the Future of Europe’507 is a major pan-European 
citizen engagement exercise. While its impact on poli-
cymaking will be understood better in the future, it will 
provide lessons on more effective citizen engagement 
that could be done more often at the EU-level.   
Technical tools and platforms are increasingly be-
ing used to engage with citizens too. The goal of 
these tools is to enhance and simplify the ways for citi-
zen engagement and participation in policymaking. One 
such platform, Decidim, was developed in Barcelona. 
The success of the Decidim platform helped to spread 
its use to other cities and regions in the world. (For ex-
ample, the Conference on the Future of Europe also runs 
through this platform).
There is a space to increase the adoption of digi-
tal government services in Europe. For the moment, 
online public services are used by less than 50% of cit-
izens. Around 48% of adult European citizens has used 
the internet for interaction with public authorities, rang-
ing from 10% (Romania) to 89% (Denmark) in different 
EU Member States. Only 38% “submitted completed 
form” to public authorities via internet508. Besides digital 
divide and access, one of the main reasons is that the 
existing services were only transposed to the digital en -
vironment without being redesigned509. According to the 
Digital compass510, it is estimated that all key public ser-
vices should be available online to EU citizens by 2030.
Citizens could be involved in the co-creation of 
(digital) public services. The digital transformation 
brings an opportunity for public administrations in the 
EU to redesign the services they offer to citizens and 
address society’s needs better. Such human-centric dig-
ital public services would be accessible, inclusive and 
transparent, while respecting personal data protection 
rules511. If the data on the adoption of digital services 
were open, it would be visible in real time whether ser-
vices are meeting user needs.  This accountability mech-
anism could contribute to orienting decisions on public 
services in the direction of citizens’ needs512. 
The involvement of citizens in policy making is 
crucial for open strategic autonomy. They can shape 
a common narrative to it. This is key for acceptance of trade-offs in any policy strategy and for citizen’s com-
mitment to the EU’s pursuit of open strategic autonomy 
In the next 20 years, a new generation Alpha 
(born between 2010 and 2025) will emerge in the 
public space. It is estimated that among others, this 
generation will live longer, stay in education more and 
be the most technologically skilled compared to the pre-
vious ones. The EU will need to monitor and ensure that 
its policies are fit for this and other future generations. 
Measures to improve social resilience in the future could 
include incentives for bottom-up innovation and active 
citizenship.
Giving more 
direct power to 
citizens could 
contribute to the 
better functioning 
of European 
democracies, 
increased social 
capital and trust in 
political processes.

SCENARIOS

63
Scenarios on the global 
standing of the EU in 2040
The following section presents constructed foresight scenarios that look at the 
EU’s standing and the role of the open strategic autonomy in four different possi-
ble futures. However, the world in 2040 is not something that can be grasped with absolute 
certainty. These scenarios therefore represent an attempt to construct a number of hypothe-
ses about the future, which can help frame assumptions about the present as much as about 
the future. By design, each of the four scenarios is at the edge of plausibility.
Scenarios enable us to explore possible futures and their potential implications by 
reframing individual and collective assumptions513. By showing gradations in the EU’s 
possible internal and external contexts in 2040, the scenarios challenge assumptions about 
the future of the EU. 
It is important to clarify that foresight scenarios are not predictions of the future, 
forecasts or desirable visions. Rather, they are coherent simulations of plausible future 
states of the world that highlight the ways in which trends, weak signals and uncertainties 
from the present could develop in the future. In so doing, foresight scenarios reveal the 
choices available today and their potential consequences for the future. 
In essence, the future cannot be predicted, although some of the elements of the 
future can already be discerned. There will inevitably be a mixture of ‘known unknowns’ 
and ‘unknown unknowns’ – so called ‘black swan’ or wild cards events. To give an example, 
foresight processes over the last 10-15 years have consistently pointed to the plausibility 
of a global pandemic. In the same way, foresight scenarios do not claim to be complete, but 
rather to give a sense of what possibilities the future could hold.
The scenario building exercise helps to increase preparedness in policymaking. 
Foresight scenarios challenge the policymaking world to consider afresh what actions it 
could and should consider taking, in order to be prepared for some future event, or to miti-
gate the effects of others. In other words, by making the future explicit and contestable, the 
scenarios can provide a springboard to consider the adequacy and effectiveness of current 
and planned policy interventions.
Eight workshops in which scenarios were co-created took place from November 
2020 to March 2021. Members of the European Commission’s dedicated working group on 
open strategic autonomy from different services participated in these workshops. In a second 
step, selected experts from EU institutions, academia, industry, policymaking and civil society 
organisations were involved in the process, in order to test the plausibility and coherence of 
the set of foresight scenarios.
A set of scenarios presented below shows what the open strategic autonomy would 
mean in each of these futures. The four scenarios have been named: ‘Green Leadership, 
‘Complex Prosperity’, ‘Economic Growth Above All’ and ‘Retreat Inwards’. They each present 
different, plausible futures of the EU in 2040.
64
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
A glimpse of the world in 2040
The EU leads by example and promotes a green vision for a carbon-neutral way of living. The EU 
and a close group of like-minded countries prioritise natural ecosystems. Together they represent 
around 30% of the world’s economy. These countries are ‘clean tech’ leaders, on track to becoming 
carbon-neutral by 2050. Renewable energy provide 100% of the electricity in the EU. The EU uses its 
soft power to convince neighbouring countries and others around the world to join this group, focused 
on the green economy and delivering on the SDGs and where GDP is no longer at the centre of the 
economic model. The EU and like-minded countries require high environmental standards as part of 
trade agreements. However, the majority of the world’s nations continue to prioritise economic wealth, 
with more relaxed trade regulations and lower environmental standards. Conflicts emerge at the glob-
al level over access to resources, economic power and in regards to trade and technology standards.GREEN 
LEADERSHIP  
65
The perspectives of open strategic 
autonomy in “Green Leadership” 
Geopolitics
In this scenario, geopolitical tensions are 
present in the majority of the world’s coun-
tries around access to resources, trade and 
standards. This competition leads to sig-
nificant rifts in a few regions. For exam-
ple, the US and China are in constant conflict regarding 
technology standards, trade, or access to raw materials 
due to their resource-intensive economies. The EU has 
increased its presence in NATO and uses the organisa-
tion not only for defence purposes, but also to promote 
EU priorities among the partners of the alliance.
Cyber surveillance and physical control of goods, people, 
and capital inside EU, along with external border control 
are utilised widely to guarantee stability of what is con-
sidered a balanced system, without too much external 
interference. High priority has recently been given to 
combating fraud from within and outside the EU. These 
mechanisms are also used to control external influence 
on social movements, to avoid political turbulence.
Technology
Based on substantial research efforts and 
innovation support, the EU is becoming ful-
ly independent of clean and digital technol-
ogies from countries outside of the green 
alliance. The culture of tech start-ups is 
flourishing. Through technology leaps, it manages a 
quick transition to a carbon neutral energy system, and 
it is even able to export surplus energy. Circular econ-
omy, material development, synthetic food production 
and agri-tech are key enabling fields driven by smart 
connectivity, also in Europe’s autonomy strategies of 
sustainability. Following a dual use paradigm, Europe is 
strong in second generation quantum computing, scal-
able satellite mesh networking, and new decentralized 
data protocols for public services. However, globally the 
technology market is fragmented. Multiple different dig-
ital standards at the international level and conflicting 
extraterritorial events are a serious weakness.
Economy 
The EU reduced its dependency on glob-
al resources drastically, through energy 
independence based on nearly 100% re-
newable power, circular economy and the 
substitution of critical raw materials where 
possible. These measures also reduced Europe’s depen-
dence on imports.Limited market reach for its high standard products is 
a problem for the EU, as their group of sustainability 
countries covers only a small share of global GDP. The 
EU tries to overcome this limitation by swapping green 
technology for scarce resources to build lasting part-
nerships and at the same time transfer the values of a 
sustainable economy for the long-term perspective of 
economic well-being.
Environment
The EU has committed to actively project 
a green agenda and carbon neutrality, cut-
ting edge technology companies and strong 
funding from central banks. Nature conser-
vation is part of the EU’s philosophy. The 
capacity of ecosystem services is strengthened; their 
use is managed sustainably through carbon taxes and 
payments for ecosystem services.
The EU tries to project its values through soft power ne-
gotiations, partnerships globally and by offering sustain-
able technology as an incentive for critical resources.
The vulnerability of the European-led bloc is the global 
interconnectedness of the nature ecosystem and cli-
mate change impacts. As long as the majority of societ-
ies do not join the sustainability path, the climate crisis 
will accelerate, natural resources will be exhausted and 
nature irreversibly destroyed.
Society
The green transition has created winners 
and losers. Income disparities, access to 
education, healthcare and technology, and 
their compounded effects represent the 
most important social challenges in the EU. 
The EU urgently needs deep social reforms, but they 
are not prioritised. Public spending centres on green in-
vestments and public budgets are strained due to low 
economic growth rates, as international trade is limited 
to only the group of sustainability countries. A malfunc-
tioning health system counteracts the image of excel-
lence that the EU is trying to sell to the rest of the world.
The EU is open to migrants, but only the ones that help 
to overcome its lack of specialists. Shelter is not some-
thing that Europe offers. Alongside all of the green effi-
ciency and digital transparency, this is a weak point for 
the continent in international debates on human rights 
and inequalities.
66
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
A glimpse of the world in 2040
Society has inched forward to create a more sustainable planet, but how sustainable it is, is not clear. 
We live in a world of relative economic prosperity and multilateralism. There are efforts towards 
the joint governance of the commons. In this multilateral world, a focus on strategic autonomy has 
equipped the EU with the ability to participate in setting the global agenda. The EU is still able to at-
tract Eastern European countries away from Russian influence. The US and China are economic leaders 
in global trade that offers growth and prosperity for the most part. The EU remains a part of this glob-
ally trading world, but continues to lag behind in the latest research and innovation trends. Citizens 
are supportive of the EU’s ecological ambitions, but they now reject traditional governance systems. 
They feel excluded by experts and are more prone to embracing conspiracy theories and believing in 
‘alternative facts’.COMPLEX 
PROSPERITY
67
The perspectives of open strategic 
autonomy in “Complex prosperity”
Geopolitics
The EU is still a global actor. However, it 
struggles to remain influential in a multilat-
eral world where the US and China lead. The 
EU is not the preferred partner for the domi-
nant regional players in Africa, Latin American or Asia, but 
keeps strategic ties with several of them. In this multilater-
al world, the UN and its agencies are the ultimate platform 
for steering global developments.
There is stability in the EU’s Southern and Eastern neigh-
bouring countries even with a recent wave of migratory 
flow coming from Sub-Saharan Africa. NATO is the institu-
tion that secures the EU’s position in the global order and 
military investments by EU Member States are low. EU de-
fence structures are now tackling cybersecurity attacks on 
corporate and industrial actors and developing intelligence 
monitoring on external economic interests.
Technology
The EU and its Member States focus on 
public programmes in frontier science at 
EU-level. Similarly, R&I budgets have been 
transferred from the national to the EU-lev-
el and are larger than ever; a fourth round of ‘moonshot 
programmes’ is targeted at relaunching the EU’s global 
leadership in R&I.
The EU’s main goals focus to manufacture and secure syn-
thetic substitutes for critical raw materials, and to stimulate 
the internal market on emerging green technologies. The 
latter should reduce a growing dependence on China and 
the US, while increasing the competitiveness of EU industrial 
and business ecosystems. European digital healthcare and 
renewable energy players are among the global leaders.
There is full alignment amongst EU members on the need 
to strengthen EU standards within technological sectors 
even more. There is a renewed push to maintain the EU as 
a central player in sectors where ethical and responsible 
research and innovation can be an asset.
Economy
In the EU economy, stakeholder-centric mod-
els have emerged, with mitigating climate 
change and environmental destruction as 
the leading driver. However, apart from core 
public investments in R&I, and strong private 
conglomerates in climate mitigation and health industries, 
EU innovation ecosystems are not flourishing enough.
EU investments mainly aim to support domestic interests. 
US players invest heavily in EU industry and the govern-
ments of EU countries are trying to help the EU players in their domestic markets with dedicated support pro-
grammes. Similarly, the EU and its Member States try to 
maintain influence in Latin America and Africa, where Chi-
na is increasing its presence.
Alongside giving financial support to EU companies, the EU is 
trying to invest in attracting the best talent, as there is an in-
creasing brain drain towards the US and Indian markets. This 
is leading to the challenge of high levels of public debt, which 
the EU institutions and Member States have to deal with.
Environment
The EU’s environmental priorities are in align-
ment with the SDGs and compliant with mul-
tilateralism. The bloc relies on the engage-
ment of its institutions and Member States in 
international fora such the new Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations comprising 15 nations, now also an alliance 
of climate mitigation frontrunners. The EU leads the new 
ecological order and supports the growing global gover-
nance of the commons (i.e. the natural environment).
EU investments pivoted largely towards climate mitigation 
technologies and renewables that have helped to secure 
Europe’s fast energy transition and independence. Strong 
political support around these options makes it easier for 
European political actors to focus on them.
There is a lack of similar policy priorities towards other en-
vironmental issues. Public funding and regulatory impulses 
targeting environmental issues other than climate change 
are more limited. An imperfect consensus between inter-
national and regional levels makes it more difficult to act 
on those issues.
Society
The EU as a whole lags behind North America 
and ASEAN on policies that are successfully 
stimulating high employment and education 
levels.
Despite continuous investments steered by European in-
stitutions, some European regions still lack robust welfare 
and labour policies. These regions are characterised by low 
levels of life satisfaction, a spike in non-communicable dis-
eases and mental health issues. 
The younger generation is experimenting with new modes 
of civic participation, albeit with limited interest from de-
cision-makers. There are increasing frictions around social 
rights, which in the past were considered to be amongst 
the core values of the EU. Intergenerational solidarity in 
Europe is fragile and pressure is mounting. Extreme pen-
sion reforms have been put in place due to the high public 
debt reinforced by ageing population.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
A glimpse of the world in 2040
This is a world where instant wealth has priority over long-term well-being. Global trade is booming. 
The EU has new alliances with Africa on raw materials. Industry 7.0 (characterised by human-machine 
interaction, computer-aided manufacturing and automated individual one-off production) is underway. 
Private interests dominate public policy. Open strategic autonomy also depends on private sector in-
terests. Polluters avoid consequences, the natural ecosystem is collapsing and social capital is low. 
However, global financial institutions are intact and functioning well. The EU is enhancing the power of 
euro. Big Tech is pervasive and winning the race for talent. Self-governing communities of like-mind-
ed people have arisen that share high levels of solidarity as well as resources. Powerful state and 
terrorist rogue actors exploit disinformation to underpin cyberwarfare. The US and India dominate 
the space race, with the EU in third place. China’s centralised political system is under pressure from 
demographics, debt and enhanced global competition.ECONOMIC 
GROWTH 
ABOVE ALL
69
The perspectives of open strategic
autonomy in “Economic growth above all”
Geopolitics
The EU is collaborating strategically with In-
dia, Africa and South America. These new and 
redefined relationships focus on economic 
connections (e.g. investment agreements). 
Deeper longer-term agreements and partnership were es-
tablished between the EU and African partners 15 years ago 
to support African trade integration, as well as digitalisation, 
and the EU is still benefitting from these. India has become 
strong in the fields of biomedicine, pharmaceuticals and 
APIs (Active pharmaceutical ingredients), important for new 
diseases and epidemics caused by climate change. An age-
ing China is under social, economic and military pressure. 
Internal social tensions have forced it to devolve power to 
the surrounding regions. However, the EU is still dependent 
on it for rare earths and lithium, with needs for lithium hav-
ing increased 60 times in the past 20 years.
Technology
Technology breakthroughs, followed by soft  
regulatory approaches, have increased and 
tech use has expanded relentlessly, empow-
ering tech companies. Following Industry 5.0 
(collaborative robots) and Industry 6.0 (boost of comput-
er-aided manufacturing), investment is now channelled to-
wards an Industry 7.0, aiming to help maintain corporate 
power and to fuel GDP.  
The EU, as well as the US space companies are investing in 
projects that prepare to mine the Moon, rich in three critical 
resources: water, helium-3 and rare earth metals, which 
is planned to start by 2045. With massive investments 
through public-private partnerships, the EU is among three 
leading players in the global technology and space race, 
although it still lags behind the US and India. Innovation 
is stimulated through venture capital investments. Richer 
Member States invest heavily in the development of ‘dual 
technologies’ that are used in both military and civic appli-
cations. AI and ‘upgrades’ of humans using augmentation 
technology has created advantages for those having the 
means and the skills. Cyber-security has become a promi-
nent issue and the private cyber-security corporations play 
a leading role now, attracting the IT talent. 
Economy
The main challenges that have emerged 
are to enhance the power of the (digital) 
euro and engage in the technology race. 
Economic growth is fuelled by unregulated 
markets. Small and medium-sized enterprises are left  
behind in this world, where strategic autonomy ambi-
tions foster only larger businesses.  The EU is a big producer of synthetic food and to some 
extent algae (which used for food, but also pharmaceu-
ticals, bioplastics, fertilisers and biofuel). The EU im-
ports more than 50% of its vegetables, fruit and meat 
(mainly from South America). Two out of the first five 
synthetic food technology companies were developed 
in the EU. They quickly expanded their food production 
globally and gained material power with the mass pro-
duction of synthetic food - which the world now needs 
to survive. In the EU, energy sources are 50/50, own 
energy versus imports.  
Environment
The EU and other continents failed to 
achieve the Sustainable Development 
Goals by 2030. Those who rely on fragile 
natural ecosystems are under pressure to 
change their source of income and place of living. Fish-
ing communities struggle because the rise in sea tem-
perature has impacted seafood habitats and fish stock. 
Coastal communities face a crisis, with internal dis-
placement and forced migrations towards neighbouring 
countries and other continents. 
The EU invests in the green technologies that are aligned 
with its economic interests. Agriculture relies more on 
chemicals, synthetic meat and high-tech food produc-
tion, as well as imports. GMOs are widespread because 
they are the only crops that can resist extreme weath-
er conditions and are required to satisfy human food 
needs. Synthetic milk, cheese, yogurt and meat have 
partly reduced the demand for land, water and energy 
and the threats of potential diseases.  
Society
Reskilling programmes are part of the 
packages offered by private companies 
in the EU to help meet new work require-
ments. However, there is still a substantial 
part of society without job security. They are turning into 
a flexible, but vulnerable lower-class workforce. Rich Eu-
ropeans can largely benefit from the use of AI and new 
technologies in healthcare prevention and treatments. 
They live longer, healthier lives. 
Investment in promoting shared values and societal co-
hesion is not a priority. Polarisation skyrockets, fuelled 
by the misuse of new technologies by extremist politi-
cal parties and non-state actors. The majority of states 
have retreated from the social sphere and from an ac-
tive construction of a better-shaped society.  
70
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
A glimpse of the world in 2040
Independence to act in one’s self-interest is the modern credo for nations in this mid-21st century 
society. This is a de-globalised world. Weakened food supply chains, growing water scarcity and the 
spreading of diseases prevail. The EU has been less negatively affected by the impact of climate 
change than other regions. The choice of food has dwindled, but the EU has still reliable food supply 
chains and unlike other regions has no existential threat of water scarcity. The EU invested heavily in 
its open strategic autonomy. The elected leaders and voting patterns have resulted in the prioritisa-
tion of the interests of an ageing society – pensions, healthcare – over those of younger generations. 
Even if that means overtaxing youth, excluding them from political power and failing to address en-
vironmental concerns adequately. Traditional military alliances and the institutions underpinning the 
Western world since 1945 have become ineffective, as each nation prioritises its own interests rather 
than aiming to reach shared goals.RETREAT 
INWARDS
71
The perspectives of open strategic 
autonomy in “Retreat inwards”
Geopolitics
Regional blocs of nations concentrate on 
reducing their dependence on critical im-
ports, which has led to a diversification of 
regulatory standards. The circular econ-
omy has become a political priority, and 
regions implement high import duties on commodities, 
to protect local production.
After the US disengaged from multilateralism and fol-
lowing the abolition of NATO in 2030, the EU founded 
the European Defence Alliance that also includes some 
non-EU countries such as Norway, Switzerland, the UK 
and Turkey. The alliance protects its southern border 
from the growing political instabilities in the Middle East.
The EU switched from fossil fuels to renewable energy 
and has reduced its energy dependence from 54% in 
2018 to 35% in 2040. The mobility transition is less 
advanced and only short-distance road transport has 
shifted to battery-powered electric vehicles. Long-dis-
tance cargo and passenger transport still rely on fossil 
fuels.
Technology
The global technology landscape has 
changed into local platforms and stan-
dards. The World Wide Web does not exist 
anymore. Instead, there is the ‘splinter-
net’, driven by protectionist policies and censorship.  
The EU continues to invest in research and innovation. 
The desire to become less dependent on critical mate-
rials and goods has created strong domestic markets 
for relevant technologies. Priorities for innovation in 
the EU include fields necessary for its independence.
Climate-change adaptation technologies are being 
developed (e.g. quantum computing for meteorology). 
Technologies that support human adaptation to the 
hostile environment (such as biological engineering) 
and defence technologies are also prioritised. In addi-
tion, there is investment in e-health i.e. remote med-
ical solutions and home-based care that uses robots, 
as well as technologies that support circularity and re-
source independence.
Economy
Remote working gained acceptance and 
digital platforms became a critical infra-
structure for the EU. Supported by a reg-
ulatory framework that effectively dis-in-
centivised foreign operators from running these platforms, EU-based platforms emerged.
In the late 2020s, China, limited their exports of criti-
cal raw materials to protect their own technology lead-
ership in electric vehicles and renewable energy. These 
developments triggered efforts in the EU to become 
less dependent on critical goods and their materials 
imports.
The resulting reduction in global trade and reduced 
GDP growth rates has reinforced several pressures 
on EU public finances. These include adaptation to 
climate change, independence from critical materials 
and goods imports, welfare system costs, and military 
expenses.
Environment
The ageing population prioritised the 
preservation of their welfare states over 
climate action. The climate targets set in 
the Paris Agreement were not reached, 
leading to a drastic increase in the frequency of ex-
treme climate events.
The EU continues to invest in climate change adapta-
tion measures, to decrease its vulnerability to extreme 
weather events. As the impact of climate change var-
ies across the EU regions, there is a growing north-
south divide within the EU.
While water scarcity in the EU has increased, the adap-
tation measures have helped to manage this challenge 
and the EU can still grow excess food.
Society
Europe’s high standard of living keeps the 
region attractive for immigrants. However, 
the EU’s ageing society has put the EU’s 
economic development at risk. The EU has 
launched programmes to promote active and healthy 
ageing and lifelong learning. In addition, AI makes the 
EU’s shrinking workforce more productive.
Social and economic divergences have led to increased 
tensions between different social groups in the EU. 
Young people have been excluded from political power, 
as policymakers do not pay attention to their needs, 
and migrants are finding it difficult to access welfare 
systems.
72
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDKey conclusions and uncertainties 
emerging from scenarios
Policy issues are characterised by a mixture of com-
plexity and uncertainty. Open strategic autonomy relat-
ed policies are long-term strategies, as they build on 
bundles of initiatives in several policy areas and fora. 
To give a better sense of what the EU could do now to 
better prepare itself for an uncertain future, we pres-
ent some key uncertainties that have emerged from the 
scenarios. Following this, the implications for the EU’s 
future open strategic autonomy related policies have 
been considered based on the analysis of the foresight 
scenario set. These can be used to help to visualise and 
understand the most important steps ahead.
Geopolitics: building alliances and politi-
cal cohesion
 As the scenarios imply, building strategic alliances 
with like-minded countries while fostering multilateral 
and rules-based international cooperation will be im-
portant elements of open strategic autonomy. These 
will be critical to ensure access to the assets and re-
sources that Europe needs to implement its green and 
digital transitions. Some scenarios suggest that the EU 
could build strategic alliances with Africa, or form an 
EU-India alliance. The scenarios point to the possibili-
ty of monopolistic exporters limiting the global supply 
of raw materials, while the EU’s dependence on food 
from South America might increase. China may also 
advance in its dominance of critical EU supply chains, 
such as ICT, medical equipment, infrastructure, with 
the EU struggling to remain influential in a multilateral 
world where the US and China lead.
 It is important to develop the EU’s security and de-
fence capacity to address potential conflicts and at-
tacks. The possibility that conflicts between regions 
may arise in the areas of standards, trade, access to 
raw materials and cyberspace is significant. In addi-
tion, the scenarios offer different pathways for the 
evolution of the EU’s security and relations with the 
NATO alliance.
 It is important to exert influence on and establish a 
clear position with regards to important global play-
ers, such as the US and China, who will likely be the 
world’s key economic and military powers in 2040. This 
will entail withstanding competition and promoting co-
operation with these powers concurrently. This could 
involve, for example, maintaining a sustainable pres-ence in the space race as this has consequences for 
the future of the EU’s communications, earth observa-
tion, and manufacturing capabilities. India and the US 
could for example dominate the space race, coupled 
with an EU ‘brain drain’ towards these countries. This 
is important to consider, because the ways in which 
India, Africa, Russia and Latin America will position 
themselves in the growing redistribution of power is 
unclear, with alternatives ranging from moving alone, 
in bilateral partnerships, or favouring developments 
and influence coming from either the West or East.
Technology: EU leadership on R&I, regula-
tory frameworks and standards
 R&I and start-up investment will be important to 
support European technological leadership. A frag-
mented global innovation ecosystem would slow down 
innovation rates, which in life sciences could delay the 
fight against any new diseases. Prioritisation of R&I 
and start-up investment could drive GDP, for exam-
ple in synthetic substitutes for rare earth elements, 
bioengineering technologies, or frontier research and 
breakthrough projects. In the digital domain, respect-
ing rules of privacy, data ownership and protection of 
digital services is a prerequisite for open strategic au-
tonomy. 
 If Europe is not strong enough in digital technologies 
and the regulation of cyberspace, European critical in-
frastructures (e.g. hospitals) as well as citizens will be 
vulnerable to potential disruptions by malicious actors.
 Promoting Responsible Research and Innovation 
(RRI), together with regulatory frameworks and stan-
dards, will be a European asset in a number of sectors. 
A lack of standards and ethical and regulatory frame-
works in R&I could make Europe vulnerable (examples 
range from autonomous vehicles, to genomics). RRI is 
therefore of considerable importance for European so-
cieties to thrive. In addition, the EU will need to have 
an impact on global technological standards in the fu-
ture in order to stay competitive.
 Private-public partnerships will be important in sus-
taining the further development of technologies such 
as AI, data, blockchain, photonics, robotics and quan-
tum computing. The EU could explore how to better 
co-design and cooperate with private investors to de-
73velop public-private funding mechanisms to further 
finance young innovative start-ups. This could include 
the promotion and facilitation of tech start-ups led by 
women that still account for only a small proportion of 
tech start-ups.
Economy: level playing field and norms in 
global trade
 Establishing a level playing field in global trade will 
contribute to ensuring the competitiveness of the EU 
economy.  Open trading conditions combined with com-
petitive advantages and favourable production condi-
tions could enable EU businesses to remain active and 
competitive across the world. European companies 
face the risk of unfair competition due to monopolis-
tic or state-backed actors. Increasing protectionism 
(policies that restrict international trade to help do-
mestic industries) can lead to a fragmentation of the 
global economy. Such a development could also limit 
the market for domestic products and harm export op-
portunities. Trade is also a means to project European 
values globally.
 The EU could shape the norms that regulate global 
markets through proactive collaboration with technol-
ogy developers, start-ups and scale-ups companies, 
research organisations, and international standardisa-
tion organisations. 
 An adequate regulatory framework with fair taxa-
tion can ensure a more diversified landscape of digi-
tal players, thanks to the digital transition. This could 
reduce the possibility of global IT giants running the 
operating systems of the digital industry and having 
the power to create service supply dependencies. 
Environment: climate change mitigation 
and adaptation, climate diplomacy, green 
technologies
 Climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as 
developing the circular economy will remain key issues 
in the future. The implementation of a circular econ-
omy is not only a pillar of environmental priority, but 
can also help to decrease the EU’s import dependence 
on critical raw materials by extending the lifecycle 
of products. All scenarios reflect the importance of a 
green transition and the negative effects of non-action, such as the increasing frequency of extreme weather 
events, or food and water scarcity.
 Climate diplomacy will be important for the future. 
Insufficient global climate action create lose-lose situ-
ations. Global efforts to combat climate change would 
create a level playing field that avoids the risk of the 
relocation of carbon-intensive industries from regions 
with high climate ambitious, to other regions (carbon 
leakage). Affected sectors include chemical, steel and 
cement production. It is important for EU economies to 
protect their industries from unfair competition (e.g. by 
implementing carbon price adjustment mechanisms).
 Green technologies are an enabler of the green tran-
sition and constitute a growing market. Building on its 
pioneering role in funding green technology develop-
ment could help the EU remain a technology leader. 
The economic importance of green technologies (e.g. 
wind power generation, direct solar to hydrogen con-
version technologies, atmospheric carbon capture 
and conversion) is growing in a world that strives to 
become climate neutral. Such technologies affect all 
sectors of the economy and are crucial for emissions 
reduction and increased circularity.
Society: social cohesion, participatory 
governance, talent attraction
 Strengthening the participation of citizens in policy-
making, as well as social and resilience, while dimin-
ishing social fragmentation, will remain priorities for 
the future. Potential vulnerabilities could emerge from 
increased polarisation and tribalism in society that 
could tear the social fabric apart, and diminish trust 
in government. 
 The alienation of citizens, especially young people, 
and their exclusion from political life is a potential 
threat.
 Attracting talent and upskilling the workforce will be 
important for the EU’s Open Strategic    Autonomy. The 
EU has to retain existing talent in Europe and to attract 
talented individuals from other regions. The EU might 
be capable of attracting highly motivated and engaged 
talent in circumstances where it continues to have high 
social and environmental standards.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
IMPLICATIONS
 FOR THE
 FUTURE
75Implications for the future
The following section presents the implications for 
leveraging the EU’s capacity to achieve and main-
tain Open Strategic Autonomy by 2040 and beyond. 
These implications highlight the ways in which the EU can 
use its existing strengths and develop further capacities, 
both by itself and through alliances. It also addresses 
current weaknesses and upcoming challenges, seize un-
derlying opportunities, and implement identified priorities 
required to shape and guarantee its open strategic auton-
omy. The implications outlined should be considered as a 
set, as in this way they can ensure establishing a coherent 
policy framework. 
The implications for the future are presented below 
across the five areas of analysis of open strategic 
autonomy. Implications square the identified priorities 
and with the strategic learnings from capacities areas of 
improvements and forward-looking trends and scenario 
insights. 
Geopolitics
Build inter-regional relations in the 
EU’s neighbourhood as a priority
The EU needs to strengthen inter-re-
gional relations, especially in its local 
neighbourhood. Current expectations concerning the 
future of the international order have shifted drastically 
in the last ten years. The world has grown more diverse 
and contested, with major powers, such as China, as-
serting not only their interests, but also their respective 
worldviews and norms. Current developments clearly 
point to the intensification of competition both at the 
global level and across key regions. In this context, the 
EU could focus its efforts on inter-regional relations, 
including EU-Asia relations that are expected to grow. 
As the world moves from global multilateralism, in-
ter-regional multilateral relations become increasingly 
important, especially regarding Eurasia, East Asia, the 
MENA and sub-Saharan Africa regions514.
The deterioration of the conditions for stability, 
development and security in the MENA region and 
Africa represents a key test for Europe’s open 
strategic autonomy. In the current highly contested 
environment, the EU needs to position itself to be more 
in the driving seat, by focusing less on its own agen-
da and focusing more on the needs of these regions 
and their people. The EU needs to prioritise their sta-
bility and resilience, policy development and resources, 
to lead a co-designed agenda with the key stakehold-ers. Developments in neighbouring regions carry direct 
implications for the EU and its Member States, while 
Europe’s engagement in these regions has been partic-
ularly intense, involving a wide range of policy initiatives 
and considerable resources. 
Framing Europe’s strategic autonomy should go 
hand in hand with shaping stronger partnerships 
with neighbouring countries and Africa. This is key 
as opposed to mainly externalising decisions taken at 
EU level515. Achieving more strategic autonomy when 
partnering with neighbouring countries and Africa re-
quires the targeted and joined-up use of these resourc-
es, including innovative forms of development finance. 
Fostering the Team Europe approach516, beyond dealing 
with the immediate impact of the pandemic and with 
the close involvement of the European Investment Bank 
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-
ment, can be part of this approach. Europe should also 
use its convening power to engage other international 
actors through broader alliances on specific priorities, 
such as providing basic health facilities, ensuring food 
security and building digital infrastructure.
Strengthen the transatlantic partnership
A robust transatlantic partnership is in EU’s stra-
tegic interest. Fostering open strategic autonomy can 
be seen as contributing simultaneously to strengthening 
the transatlantic partnership, bargaining more effective-
ly with the US where positions differ, and preparing for 
possible future discontinuities in US politics and foreign 
policy. The strength of the partnership depends on the 
strength of the partners. This concerns not only the cen-
tral role of NATO in Europe’s collective defence, but also 
cooperation between the EU and the US to reform and 
strengthen the rules-based international order517, 518. 
Advancing open strategic autonomy would make the EU 
a stronger partner both by equipping Europeans to take 
more responsibility for their security, alongside the US 
or on their own, and by reinforcing the EU’s regulatory 
power to engage with the US and others in rule making. 
Advancing open strategic autonomy would en-
able the EU to define and defend its position on 
its own, in bilateral and in multilateral fora. It can 
also create incentives for transatlantic compromise as 
opposed to simply aligning with the positions of others. 
This is important even in the context of the renewed 
partnership, for instance if the EU and the US may not 
see eye to eye on some issues, such as trade or digital 
76
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDmatters. Moreover, were the US to reduce some of its 
external engagements, by choice or necessity, or revert 
to a more nationalist and unilateral posture at some 
point in the future, the EU should be prepared to uphold 
its agenda on its own, while still seeking cooperation 
with the US where possible.
Enable the EU as a laboratory of multilateral-
ism and multi-level governance
The EU has a vital role to play in bringing multi-
lateralism into the 21st century. This can be done 
by ensuring it is relevant and effective in the emerging 
context and future-fit, particularly in coping with and 
meeting the expectations of the multiplicity of players, 
in particular the rising economic powers. From an open 
strategic autonomy perspective, the EU needs to invest 
in this higher-level reframing of the global governance, 
thus building momentum for anticipatory governance519. 
In fact, it should be at the forefront of this transition 
process. This is key to setting the rules and defining the 
process for a better-functioning, more open, and equi-
table global economy and multilateral relationships520.
The EU can drive the forces of change in reform-
ing international institutions to make them fit 
for the challenges of this century. It is important 
to ensure that these institutions are more representa-
tive, less bureaucratic and more effective in advancing 
multilateralism. This will increase respect for these in-
stitutions and the rule of law. The EU is well-positioned 
to identify the basis for such reforms, drawing on its 
experience in multi-level governance, to ensure fairer 
working structures and procedures. To do so, the EU 
needs to promote its own interests and values using its 
leverage in organisations such as the WHO and WTO, 
as well as to enhance the legitimacy of the multilateral 
order in cooperation with regional organisations such 
as the African Union, the Organisation for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, ASEAN, G7, G20 and more521.
Position the EU on US-China rivalry
The EU has to position itself considering the in-
creasing US-China rivalry. This growing rivalry raises 
the question of how to coordinate better the pursuit of 
open strategic autonomy. An approach could include a 
definition of the EU’s approach to China, with a sustained 
dialogue with the US and other like-minded partners on 
the implications of China’s rise522. The EU could also act 
a moderator to enhance its contribution to agenda-set-
ting, open avenues for building new strategic alliances. Strengthen the EU’s soft power and ability to 
compete in setting global standards
The EU needs to develop and maintain the same 
level of agility and purpose as its competitors. 
This will entail building worldwide alliances and using 
international institutions, and focusing on the critical 
areas where it can exert the most influence. In order 
to strengthen its standardisation power, the EU could 
connect its vast experience in setting internal rules and 
de facto international standards with its research and 
technological excellence. 
The EU could focus on identifying critical areas 
and technologies for standardisation. This would 
entail monitoring international developments of com-
petitors, as well as the connection between research 
and standardisation, particularly in critical areas (such 
as digitalization). A proper and fast approach to stan-
dardization is needed to advance economic gains, 
growth, sustainability and competitiveness, and societal 
benefits from digitalization. The speed of digital devel-
opments and global shifts requires bold action523.
Embed space and strengthen the EU’s defence 
and security policy
Critical requirements to advance the EU’s strategic 
autonomy include enhancing coherence between 
the recently established frameworks for defence 
cooperation within the EU. Another important aspect 
is the strengthening of Europe’s defence technology and 
its industrial base. Fostering open strategic autonomy 
will contribute to better collaboration between the EU 
and its allies whenever possible, and to be more self-re-
liant when needed. A strong defence base will enable the 
EU to play a more incisive role in NATO.
A strong defence and security capacity will bring 
the EU closer to its neighbours. Europe’s will and 
capacity to take more responsibility for its own security 
and that of others, in particular in the EU neighbour-
hood, is required for the EU to be able to advance its 
interests, values and agenda in a world of growing geo-
political struggles. 
The Strategic Compass arrives at a time when 
there is a need to more fully integrate space into 
EU security and defence. The Strategic Compass524 
is the EU’s first real opportunity to craft an EU Space 
and Defence Strategy that can simultaneously link var-
ious policy domains, while also enhancing the visibility 
77and importance of space for security and defence. Oth-
er strategies such as the existing Connectivity Strategy 
with Asia and/or the EU Maritime Security Strategy can 
also benefit from the work conducted under the Com-
pass. New strategies on the Indo-Pacific may also ben-
efit from a more coherent EU approach to space and 
defence.
The Strategic Compass could elevate space and 
defence to a political level through the develop-
ment of an ‘EU Space and Defence Strategy’525, 
526. While recognising the technological and political au-
tonomy of the EU in space matters, there is also scope 
to enhance EU-NATO cooperation on space527. The EU 
could increase its cooperation with new NATO space 
bodies and initiatives, beyond exchange of informa-
tion. The scope of the Strategic Partnership Agreements 
(SPA) with Japan and Canada could be enhanced, espe-
cially as the SPAs already recognise the importance of 
space528.
Build political cohesion
A strategic approach to positioning the EU in the 
world entails building political cohesion. The con-
vergence of Member States around a shared vision for 
security and defence and an agreed set of priorities is 
essential. This depends on a common assessment of 
challenges and opportunities, including a strengthened 
and shared strategic culture. It further requires adap-
tation of the distribution of competences between the 
EU and Members States that enable strategic planning 
and joined-up decision-making as institutional require-
ment. Political cohesion and institutional requirements 
are both key to enable the EU to prioritise current and 
future material and immaterial requirements to secure 
its open strategic autonomy. These requirements refer 
to the assets and resources that the EU needs to imple-
ment its priorities. They comprehend a well-functioning 
single market, a strong technology and industrial basis, 
a highly skilled workforce, secure critical infrastructures, 
reliable supplies of energy and critical raw materials, 
and adequate military capabilities. In summary, the 
challenge ahead is to build internal political cohesion 
and policy integration (i.e. remove policy silos), combin-
ing institutional memory or past lessons learned with 
existing evidence and alternative futures, based on a 
strong EU anticipatory capability529. 
Political cohesion is key to enable the EU to act on 
maritime security530. The EU has a major stake in pro-tecting the global maritime rules-based order. It is vital 
for its economic, food, energy, resource and digital se-
curity. Threats range from terrorism, power competition 
and hybrid tactics beyond traditional confrontation. The 
use of oceans and seas for global trade are also being 
tested with lines of communication and critical infra-
structure at risk. The EU needs to strengthen its capacity 
to guarantee its infrastructures and freedom of navi-
gation by averting risks from having access to logistic 
hubs, supply routes and choke points or being inhibited 
by hybrid threats. Ensuring coherence among existing 
and future EU policies is therefore key, as it is coordina-
tion between Member States. These include strategies 
on connectivity, the Indo-Pacific, ocean governance and 
maritime security. It also includes coordination of Mem-
ber States naval forces and assets, as well as enhancing 
surveillance in critical zones. 
The same is true to ensure continued freedom of 
access to air space and outer space531. Aggressive 
aerial postures that rely on defensive and offensive 
capabilities, as well as the technological race in these 
domains constitute an increasing threat for EU security 
and prosperity. Information sharing between Member 
States, as well as joint training and coordinated action, 
are key. Being at the forefront of aerospace technolog-
ical developments is critical to secure access to the in-
ternational air space and outer space, and it contributes 
towards building technological sovereignty. Partnerships 
are important to facilitate logistics. Most importantly, 
political cohesion across Member States is paramount 
to ensure interoperability and coordination between 
military and civil operations, as well as to enable the EU 
to engage globally in regulation and standard setting.
The cyber-diplomacy toolbox instruments is a 
good example of advancing political cohesion in 
the EU532,. It provides a framework to better face and 
respond to threats to cyberspace. The toolbox should be 
strengthened, both in its coercive instruments via sanc-
tions533, and in its collaborative instruments via strate-
gic dialogues and capacity building. The EU should en-
sure interoperability and coordination between Member 
States when developing political responses, technolo-
gies and innovation. Defence networks and secure com-
munications links need to be reinforced, as they are a 
direct target for adversaries. The ongoing revision of the 
Directive on security of network and information sys-
tems (NIS directive)534 and the adoption of common 
binding rules, and the establishment of clear gover-
78
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDnance for all EU institutions, bodies and agencies will be 
paramount. Finally, a combination of an inward looking 
and a globally oriented Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox may 
be necessary.
Technology
Enable the EU to achieve digital 
sovereignty
There are three essential require-
ments for the EU’s digital technology 
leadership and sovereignty. These are: i) unleash-
ing the potential of and scaling up the EU’s start-ups 
through an innovation-friendly ecosystem and better 
functioning capital markets; ii) international standard-
isation that play a role in defining a “level playing field” 
in the digital realm; iii) designing regulatory frameworks 
that foster innovation in line with EU values. 
Preparing the EU to become a leader in digital 
technologies, such as AI, requires significant in-
vestment in research, innovation and deployment, 
skills, computing infrastructure, data quality and 
data sovereignty. The leading role of the US and Chi-
na in developing and applying digital technologies un-
derscore the momentous implications of technological 
competition for the ability of Europeans to shape their 
future535. The EU needs to increase its efforts in research 
excellence and leadership in some industrial sectors, to 
be able to scale them up and translate innovation into 
economic growth. Achieving digital sovereignty in Eu-
rope entails strengthening research and innovation and 
keeping talent in EU companies536. 
The EU needs to maintain its international profile 
in regulation of digital technologies (including AI 
and data) and standardisation. To ensure a trust-
worthy AI, beneficial for society, international cooper-
ation with like-minded democracies on the governance 
of AI is crucial537. There are already significant overlaps 
among ethical AI principles in countries and suprana-
tional organisations around the world (e.g. US, Japan, 
Australia, OECD)538. At the same time, digital standardi-
sation of technologies (such as 5G, IoT, Cloud, Cyberse-
curity and Data Technologies) is key to leveraging the 
EU’s ability for leadership in digital technologies, or in 
the digital domain.
Enhance digital resilience 
We need to prepare society and institutions for the 
digital and green transitions. This can be achieved through the piloting and creation of experimentation 
spaces539. Public-private partnerships and joint digital 
capacities need to be deployed in the areas of AI, cyber, 
super- and quantum computing, quantum communica-
tion and blockchain. 
Developing cutting-edge strategic capacities is 
key for the design and use of digital solutions at 
scale, with interoperability, in digital infrastruc-
tures. Some examples could include extensive 5G and 
future 6G networks and deep technology. For example, 
blockchain and distributed legers technologies offer sig-
nificant potential for enhanced resilience in trade and 
supply chains, manufacturing, energy, health and public 
and third sectors540. 
The use of AI and big data analytics more broadly 
could discover patterns that are important for im-
peding crises. AI can be used to predict humanitarian 
crises541. Extending the use of AI-enabled disaster risk 
management, or infrastructure maintenance, could help 
the EU to become more resilient542.
Strengthen Science, Technology and Innova-
tion systems 
Science, Technology and Innovation systems (STI) 
are expected to undergo considerable disruption 
in the years ahead, due to the deep and wide im-
pact of digital technologies on research and in-
novation, R&I processes and innovation systems. 
This is expected to revolutionize STI systems and poten-
tially make parts of them redundant. The result may not 
prove conducive for the EU, given that scientific and re-
search excellence is the EU’s main strength on the tech-
nology front, and that open strategic autonomy needs 
to maintain a careful watch on these developments. 
Open Strategic Autonomy is expected to have 
both negative and positive effects on STI systems. 
Policy design that is used to advance open strategic au-
tonomy should be based on reducing critical one-sid-
ed technological dependencies543. Controls on inward 
investments need to be designed carefully, so as not 
to act as barriers to mobility, collaboration and genuine 
investments in research and innovation.
International partnerships are key for Science, 
Technology and Innovation systems and need to 
be safeguarded. These include synergies through inter-
national partnership and multistakeholder engagement 
and initiatives544. STI systems need to be appropriately 
79resourced to ensure that the dynamic capabilities, skills 
and agile platforms are in place to meet sudden crises, 
as well as the pursuit of longer-term research agendas. 
As a critical strategic asset, the EU needs to mon-
itor the state of its Science, Technology and In-
novation systems. This should be done not purely in 
terms of providing sufficient financial and other facili-
ties, infrastructures and resources, but also to ensure 
resilience, in particular of researchers and the research 
community, and to address disruptive influences, both 
internal and external. 
STI systems are strategic assets that the EU 
should protect and strengthen. They contribute to 
achieving SDGs, eradicating poverty, as well as GDP 
growth and attracting global talent, firms and invest-
ment. The EU will be highly reliant on them in the future 
to support the development of cutting-edge research 
and innovation, technological capacities, and analytical 
and technical skills. 
Economy
Enable the EU to act strategically 
Open Strategic Autonomy requires 
EU ability to set economic objectives 
and act independently in an interde-
pendent system. This requires first, political cohesion 
about the direction of economic policies in the EU and 
the world. Second, institutional structures that allow 
strategic planning and joined-up decision making to play 
out regulatory and political power. Third, material assets 
such as a well-functioning single market, a strong tech-
nology and industrial basis, a highly skilled workforce, 
secure critical infrastructures, and reliable supplies of 
energy and critical raw materials to play out market 
power. Ultimately, the EU and Member States need to 
build an economic agenda on such shared priorities in 
order to be able to play out their strategy globally.
Growing economic coherence could strengthen the 
EU’s capacity to act as a unified front. The EU’s pol-
icy efforts to advance cohesion and integration are an 
important building block for open strategic autonomy. 
These include streamlining the EU’s regional policy and 
structural funds, and completing the Single Market. By 
co-designing and implementing a more equitable eco-
nomic model, open strategic autonomy approaches and 
their embedding in key EU policies including the Euro-
pean Green Deal, Next Generation EU and Cohesion, will prove more robust. As EU economies are highly inter-
linked in global value chains, the ‘open’ aspect of the 
economy will be the key to the success of it. 
Open Strategic Autonomy in economy is a mix of 
proactive and defensive elements. Proactive ele-
ments contain advances in forward-looking initiatives in 
economic, industrial and trade agenda that enable the 
EU’s own choices and scope. They cover, for example, 
rule-making and standard-setting at the EU and mul-
tilateral level, from climate to digital issues, and con-
tributions to rules-based cooperation at large. Defen-
sive elements aim at enhancing the resilience of the 
EU’s economy, reducing its dependencies, mitigating its 
vulnerabilities. Strengthening the EU’s economic mar-
ket power is required for both proactive and defensive 
strategies.
The EU needs to level openness and protection-
ism. Open strategic autonomy requires both openness 
of the EU’s economy and building up resilience against 
threats and challenges from foreign economic powers. 
Key elements are the establishment of a level play-
ing field that enables trade and investment based on 
shared rules and reciprocity, and tackling practices that 
distort trade and undermine the EU’s competitiveness.
The EU could help other free-trade areas to prog-
ress in integration of the economies, while pushing 
for global trade liberalisation. The EU with its expe-
rience in building up the most advanced single market 
could support, for example, the African Union in further 
shaping their African Continental Free Trade Area. This 
could support the development of economies, ensure 
balanced economic relationships with the EU, and be a 
lever to project EU values to other world regions. 
Increase sustainable competitiveness of the 
EU’s economy
The EU needs to decrease asymmetric econom-
ic dependencies to enhance the EU’s regulatory 
power. Leveraging the full potential of the Single Mar-
ket, and achieving and enforcing a level playing field 
with other major economies, are considered essential 
steps to uphold the EU’s competitiveness and to sustain 
growth. These are key to preserving the economic power 
base that underpins the EU’s regulatory power and open 
strategic autonomy.
The EU has to move ahead to strengthen the com-
petitiveness of its economy. Big emerging economies 
80
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDare growing faster, advancing in achieving competitive 
advantages in particular sectors, not only in terms of 
cost leadership, but also in the technological leadership. 
The EU needs to identify critical strategic areas of its 
economy that are relevant to achieve its goal of the 
green and digital transition and where the EU is able 
to retain or become a global leader. Smart specialisa-
tion strategies and industry strategies need to combine 
actionable research and innovation, industry and policy 
to accelerate the prioritised sectors. Up- and reskilling 
initiatives will be a key task to avoid job-skill mismatch-
es in a transforming economy. Increasing attractiveness 
for foreign talent will be necessary in times of shrinking 
workforce.  
Global connectivity will be needed to achieve 
competitiveness. Achieving global leadership requires 
openness to combine the best resources and production 
and market conditions globally. Economic and innova-
tion policies need to consider their global dimension and 
global impact. Global value chains will increasingly be 
the driver of economic competitiveness. Trade agree-
ments will become more important to raise the compet-
itiveness of industries. 
The EU needs to care for the resilience of critical 
supply chains. Strengthening the EU’s supply chains 
and fostering the implementation of the EU connectivity 
strategy, are central to both reducing asymmetric de-
pendencies and help shape multilateral regimes in line 
with the EU’s values and interests. Energy, critical raw 
materials, and medicines are among the priority areas. 
Both the EU and global demand for critical raw materi-
als is expected to rise sharply, driven by the growth of 
emerging economies and the digital and green transition. 
While the competition for these resources will intensify, 
the EU faces the twofold challenge of the concentration 
of supplies and obstacles to trade diversification, such 
as state fragility and the risk of economic coercion545. 
Securing strategic and critical assets is an import-
ant aspect of open strategic autonomy. Global co-
operation and openness go hand in hand with securing 
critical assets, whether they be strategically relevant in-
telligent property rights, companies, or infrastructures. 
The EU needs to balance openness and protectionism 
to avoid a takeover of the EU’s critical assets, whilst 
harvesting the benefits of collaboration and competition 
of economies. Navigating a more fragmented global economy
The EU needs to prepare for a more diversified 
global economy. With more emerging economies be-
coming dominant players, global competition will diver-
sify further. The EU needs to monitor possible economic 
prospects and broaden and/or intensify its economic re-
lationships. While some foreign economies are pursuing 
strong industrial policies, the EU needs to adapt compe-
tition and industry policy accordingly.
Diversification of value chains is key to increas-
ing their resilience. Being too dependent on a limited 
number of dominant suppliers, intermediaries or mar-
kets is increasingly risky. The growing emerging econ-
omies will offer options for diversification. Nearshoring 
and reshoring might be options for supply of securi-
ty-related issues, such as medical equipment. 
A stronger international role of the euro contrib-
utes to the EU’s open strategic autonomy. A more 
diversified global currency landscape provides enhanced 
stability and improved resilience of the international fi-
nancial system. Reinforcing the international role of the 
euro will be key component of economic sovereignty. It 
reduces the EU’s dependence on the US dollar-dominat-
ed global financial system. It can contribute to reduc-
ing transaction and borrowing costs, diminish risks and 
lower the EU’s exposure to the manipulation of financial 
interdependence by others546. 
Design and export a new EU economic model 
The EU needs to restate its commitment to rules-
based, multilateral cooperation. Interdependence 
and connectivity are both platforms for cooperation and 
mutual gains and arenas of geopolitical and geo-eco-
nomic competition. They can be harnessed to promote 
the EU’s interests and values in partnership with others, 
but they can be manipulated or weaponised by others in 
ways that undermine the EU’s goals, security and pros-
perity. As well as cooperating with like-minded countries 
and international institutions, these could include club-
like arrangements, inclusive multilateral frameworks 
and trans-national networks with non-state actors, such 
as (EU) businesses and civil society, or subnational ones 
like cities. The overarching objective would be to con-
tinue to support international cooperation, but to do so 
with a good dose of pragmatism, directionality and in-
novation, to address open strategic autonomy concerns 
within a responsible global change agenda. 
81The EU is best placed to deploy a major initia-
tive, to craft and pilot a new more equitable and 
sustainable economic model that is distributive 
by design. The EU could lead the shift from outdated 
fossil fuel-based economic approaches, to a new eco-
nomic model to underpin and enable the green and dig-
ital transitions. Innovative economic policy approaches 
and legislative reforms need to incentivise and regulate 
the transformation of industry, services and lifestyles. 
Green and digital transition could be advantageous for 
open strategic autonomy by increasing the resilience of 
the economy against climate change impacts and re-
ducing (energy) resource dependency. 
The twin green and digital transition could also 
serve as a model for other world regions. It would 
enhance the EU’s role in supporting inter-regional rela-
tions, the neighbourhood and less developed countries. 
Global problems such as climate change must have 
global action, they need to be more open in the sense of 
getting more countries, industries and people involved 
to contribute, because this will improve the achieve-
ments and benefits for all. 
The EU should integrate adequate sustainabil-
ity criteria when establishing new and updating 
existing trade agreements. This will enable a level 
playing field for the economy, lay out climate action, 
fairness, and workers and human rights as standards to 
global partners. 
Environment
Continue to pursue a leading role 
in climate diplomacy
Coordinated diplomatic efforts are re-
quired to ensure that that the green 
transition becomes a global effort. International co-
ordination is key for the Paris Agreement to succeed547. 
The energy transition will require targeted diplomatic 
efforts to ensure that energy exporters to the EU, in-
cluding Algeria and Russia, are not destabilised. Others, 
such as China, the main exporter of rare earths required 
for the green transition, stand to benefit and may seek 
to use their assets to influence EU policy. This highlights 
the complex web of diplomatic relations, which the EU 
will have to navigate to ensure that the Green Deal can 
work globally, if it is to work at Member State level.
The EU should continue to lead by example to 
maintain its role as pace maker of the green tran-sition. The EU’s commitment to green and digital tran-
sitions will secure its position among the world’s green 
leaders. This leadership will serve as an important driv-
er for the signatories of the Paris Agreement to ramp 
up efforts to meet their targets. Advancing the climate 
change agenda internationally, and implementing envi-
ronmental standards as a front runner commands re-
spect and could secure support for the EU’s own position 
for responsible global change.
Adapt to climate change by managing risks
The EU needs to protect critical assets from the 
impacts of climate change and to strengthen its 
disaster prevention and coping mechanisms, ca-
pabilities and competencies. The effects of the cli-
mate crisis, such as flooding, could affect EU ports and 
coastal areas and related industries as well as its sup-
pliers worldwide, slowing down productivity and causing 
disruptive migration flows. By preserving critical EU as-
sets, such as infrastructures, the EU takes action on dif-
ferent fronts, namely: (i) countering the risk of climate/ 
environmental crises through effective contingency 
plans; (ii) monitoring the resilience of critical assets to 
climate and environmental impacts, (iii) monitoring and 
strengthening societal resilience; and (iv) reducing re-
source dependencies.
Lead and harness the green transition
The green transition can be a catalyst to mod-
ernise EU industry and gain green technology 
leadership. Decarbonising the entire economy by 2050 
will require fundamental changes in the way all eco-
nomic sectors work. The green transition requires sub-
stantial investments that can increase innovation. As a 
frontrunner in implementing the green transition, the EU 
can gain a first mover advantage and develop the green 
technologies that are required to complete the green 
transition in the EU. Gaining technology leadership in 
areas with future relevance will put the EU industry in a 
position to provide other regions with the technologies 
they need to implement their green transitions.
A more circular economy could provide a double 
dividend for the EU. Closing material loops would re-
duce the environmental footprint of the EU and sup-
port the green transition. At the same time, material 
independence will play an increasing role as a growing 
population might lead to an increase in scarcity of re-
sources and significantly higher prices. A circular econ-
omy would make the EU less dependent on imports of 
82
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDraw materials and in this way substantially contribute to 
open strategic autonomy.
The EU needs to further develop, and build on the 
experience of targeted industrial action plans and 
related multi-stakeholder alliances. This should be 
done in parallel to boosting innovation efforts. Examples 
of such alliances include the European Battery Alliance 
launched in 2017, the recent European Clean Hydrogen 
Alliance, and the European Raw Materials Alliance. By 
joining forces, Europeans can benefit from scale as op-
posed to dispersing their efforts, which would undermine 
innovation, competitiveness and security. By strength-
ening its innovation and industrial power base in clean 
technologies, the EU will also be in a stronger position 
to set the standards of the green transition, such as in 
the hydrogen market and in the green bond market548.
Reduce the risk of carbon leakage
Carbon leakage has not affected the energy-in-
tensive industries at large to date. Energy-intensive 
sectors in the EU are subject to the EU Emission Trad-
ing System (EU ETS). This trading system puts a price 
on greenhouse gas emissions, incentivising energy-in-
tensive economic sectors to reduce their emissions. 
Some groups have claimed that this has already put 
energy-intensive sectors at a disadvantage compared 
to their global competition, as other regions do not re-
quire these sectors to pay for their emissions. However, 
several analyses indicate that no carbon leakage has 
been caused so far, as the EU ETS also implement pro-
tective measures, such as free allocation and innovation 
support.549 
Policy measures can reduce the risk of carbon 
leakage and pave the way to industrial technolo-
gy leadership. Deep decarbonisation of the energy-in-
tensive industries might further increase the operating 
costs of this sector and could make additional protec-
tive measures necessary, such as a carbon boarder tax 
to safeguard the competitiveness of a zero-carbon EU 
industry sector. An industry sector that is protected from 
unfair competition can gain a head start when it comes 
to low-carbon innovation and therefore gain a first mov-
er advantage.Society
A robust approach to social 
cohesion 
Ensuring that EU social values and 
fundamental rights are at the fore-
front of policy initiatives is key. In this regard, 
strengthening the application of the EU Charter of Fun-
damental Rights in Member States is key. While drafting 
national law and policies to which the Charter applies, it 
is crucial to ensure that such law and policies are inter-
preted and reviewed against the Charter550. The preva-
lence of fairness, justice, solidarity, inclusion, tolerance 
and non-discrimination will strengthen the cohesion of 
EU societies as well as reinforce the EU’s position in the 
world. Investing in human rights, democracy and the 
rule of law is essential to achieving fairer, greener, more 
resilient and inclusive societies551.  
The EU is best-placed to take the initiative in set-
ting standards for the protection of citizens. This will 
entail actions to deliver on the principles of the European 
Pillar of Social Rights. The EU could explore ways of co-de-
signing such standards with like-minded global players, 
including relevant international institutions. By investing in 
these global change efforts, the EU can expect to attract 
like-minded talent and industries to the EU.
More ambitious and proactive approaches should 
reflect the new realities of a post-pandemic world. 
The focus on green and digital transitions has important 
implications for EU society, from impacts on skills to new 
definitions of civil liberties, with a broader conception of 
social protection and a potential opening for the rein-
vigoration of the EU‘s ambitions in the social sphere552. 
The new social realities and emerging challenges (de-
mographic, democratic, ideological, value-based) faced 
in the years leading up to 2040 highlight the need for 
policy design to focus more on social needs.
Digital and green transitions might require social 
interventions (such as safety nets), to optimise 
positive transformations and minimise negative 
disruptions in society. In this context, the EU needs to 
look at all social indicators and adopt a transformative 
‘social model thinking’. If we make sure that no one is 
left behind,   social tensions can be reduced. This can fa-
cilitate the process of transitions. Ensuring that people 
and industries are supported fairly and adequately, and 
reducing unequal distributional effects is key.
83Transforming work and skills and attracting 
talent
A strategic definition of key areas and fields in 
which the future workforce needs to be trained 
and skilled is crucial. This should be done in co-cre-
ation with citizens and other societal actors. The re-
newed European Skills Agenda aims to support labour 
market actors by strengthening sustainable competi-
tiveness (European Green Deal), having social fairness 
(European Pillar of Social Rights), and improving social 
and economic resilience to be better prepared for future 
crisis553.
It will be important for the EU to ensure that edu-
cation programmes can deliver critical skills need-
ed up to 2040 and beyond. Training and re-skilling 
programmes have to guarantee that the EU’s workforce 
remains competitive in the key areas for open strategic 
autonomy. The implementation of adequate education 
and training programmes is also a way to secure social 
cohesion within the EU and avoid EU brain drain. Given 
the impact of demographic change, ageing population 
and declining workforce, a critical issue for Europe is 
that young people in particular, need to see opportuni-
ties for their future in Europe, through new jobs, skills, 
studies or trainings. 
Alongside digital skills, the skills that remain im-
portant for the future include critical thinking, 
creative problem solving, and teamwork554. With 
the higher penetration of digital technologies in our ev-
eryday lives, the need for skills such as empathy, care 
for each other, adaptation to change and its manage-
ment in complex environments, will remain. These skills 
are not only developed in schools, but also at home and 
at work and throughout life. While automation will sub-
stitute some jobs, a human workforce will be needed to 
engage in roles that require interaction, such as teach-
ing, caregiving, or managing others555. 
Europeans will need to improve their literacy in a 
number of areas. For example, political, policy knowl-
edge, media literacy, civic competence and health liter-
acy will be key for future societies. ‘Futures literacy’, i.e. 
the ability to better understand the role that the future 
plays in our lives and move beyond “a dependency on 
the illusion of certainty and the fragilities this creates”, 
will be equally important556.Engage citizens in policymaking and promote 
active citizenship
There is a need for citizen engagement in policy-
making that can support stronger societal cohe-
sion and active citizenship. Policy co-design means 
a strong collaboration in society beyond party politics 
and experts’ opinions. Participatory governance through 
which policy solutions are co-developed, means bring-
ing citizens’ knowledge, expectations, visions and imag-
inaries into policy processes557. Through the inclusion 
of larger number of people in policymaking (based on 
random selection558), deliberative processes can make 
the governance more inclusive559. 
Citizen engagement can enhance legitimacy and 
trust in political institutions by giving citizens 
a role in policymaking560. By increasing partici-
pants’ knowledge of political processes and institutions 
through deliberations, as well as raising awareness of 
the complexity and implications of certain policies, po-
larisation, populism and disinformation in societies can 
be decreased561.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND
An expert and stakeholders enquiry based on Online Delphi 
survey was designed to prioritise the relevant forward-looking 
issues most likely to influence shaping and securing the EU’s 
open strategic autonomy by 2040. Statements covering trends, 
emerging issues and uncertainties related to open strategic auton-
omy, were drawn from literature and scenario analysis. 241 experts 
assessed these statements in terms of their impact on achieving the 
EU’s open strategic autonomy, the urgency for the EU to act on them, 
the EU’s capacity to act on them and their likelihood of occurrence. 
Annex 2 briefly introduces the Delphi process employed, the 
characteristic of participating experts, the statements and 
key results achieved. The results give an indication of priorities for 
achieving and securing open strategic autonomy by 2040. They high-
light relevant forward-looking issues most likely to influence shaping 
and securing the EU’s open strategic autonomy by 2040.  
The identified priorities are key for Europe to build on exist-
ing capacities and reduce known vulnerabilities, as well as to 
better prepare for the future. They will be crucial for exploiting 
upcoming opportunities and transforming challenges into potential for 
positive transformation. BOX: Online Delphi on

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDAnnexes
1 Annex 1 – Assumptions 
The Commission Services’ set of assumptions562 are 
organised below. First, general assumptions stemming 
from the initial online survey are outlined in terms of 
overall expectations and desires in 2040. Second, as-
sumptions from the online survey are depicted accord-
ing to open strategic autonomy dimensions in 2040, 
also differentiating expectations and desires. Third, ad-
ditional assumptions identified via a workshop are de-
scribed. Finally, assumptions are clustered into a final 
set that were challenged in the scenarios.
Overall assumptions for expected and desired 
EU’s open strategic autonomy 
The overall assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic 
autonomy expectations in 2040 identified through the 
online survey can be summarised as: ‘a Federal Europe, 
which is paramount for securing its open strategic au-
tonomy, has not yet being achieved in spite the fact that 
Europe remains a key global market’. Its building blocks 
are: 
• A federal Europe will remain a political goal 
• The EU remains a key global market
A Federal Europe is key for securing EU’s open strategic 
autonomy. Moving towards a Federal Europe is key to 
implement an effective open strategic autonomy strat-
egy and lead by example in areas such as peacekeeping, 
disaster and risk management, and humanitarian crisis 
from climate change.
EU’s open strategic autonomy has a threefold objective 
of reducing dependencies, ensuring global leadership 
and securing data control. It means removal of energy 
and raw material dependencies, EU global leadership in 
geopolitics, trade, environmental policy and social rights, 
and control of the IT infrastructures operating in the 
Union, with EU citizens controlling the use of their data.
The EU is considered as a key global market, which en-
ables the Union to secure top trade indicators and lead 
the race towards zero emission. By 2040, the top-5 
leading economies in the world are seeking access to 
the Single Market with the EU, China and the US bat-
tling for global markets of high value / hi-tech products. 
The EU will be able to surpass most equal rivals in key 
trade indicators and its innovative industry secures a 
front-runner position in the race towards zero emission.A stagnant economy, demographic developments and 
internal divisions after the COVID-19 crisis together 
with global economic and military rivalries weakens the 
EU soft power and both its global role and economic 
position. Economic and military rivalries and a stagnant 
economy together with demography and internal divi-
sions weakens the EU as a soft power, with its foreign 
policy able to focus mainly on crisis management and 
agenda setting. In reality, the economic share of GDP 
of the EU is below 20% despite a partly reshoring of 
industry. 
In 2040, the world is still struggling to address glob-
al problems and the EU is unable to maintain its open 
strategic autonomy. The EU, the US and China agree on 
implementing a unified position for global governance. 
At the same time, the EU is setting its standards higher 
than ever for non-EU companies that are willing to in-
vest in or trade with the Union. However, the EU is able 
to secure autonomy only in the field of medical equip-
ment, with dependences on raw materials remaining a 
real treat for the future of its economy. Hence, is the Eu-
ropean push for autonomy heading towards a dystopia?
The overall assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic 
autonomy desires in 2040 can be summarised as: ‘a 
Federal Europe has enabled the EU to secure its open 
strategic autonomy and to deliver to its citizens, which 
increased its global credibility as a decisive actor and 
partner and enabled it to challenge others to follow’. Its 
building blocks are:
• The EU is perceived as a reliable, stable and fair 
partner
• The EU will be able to manage increased risks/di-
sasters/impacts connected to climate change
• Multilateralism remains a global force
The EU Federation, as a model for social cohesion and 
economic development, enabled the Union’s open stra-
tegic autonomy and its global role for peacekeeping 
and world stabilisation, successfully managing disas-
ters and humanitarian crisis caused by climate change. 
The European Federation achieves full strategic auton-
omy in energy and raw materials, allowing it to imple-
ment fully-fledged external and trade policies, develops 
a sustainable leading economy, free of dependencies 
on any other country or entity. The EU’s position as a 
strategically autonomous actor gives its increased cred-
ibility as a peace actor and functions as a deterrent to 
87destabilisation in the world. The EU is truly autonomous 
and able to manage disasters and humanitarian crises 
caused by climate change. 
The EU makes it 10 years early in the race towards zero 
emission thanks to its innovative industry. By 2040, the 
EU becomes the first climate-neutral continent in the 
world, with value-driven firms and a clean and digital-
ised industry delivering 30% of GDP. The EU as the lead-
ing world region to export green and digital goods and 
services. EU digital technology is at the cutting-edge, 
autonomous, and interoperable at the global level. 
In 2040, the EU hard and soft power protects and de-
livers for EU citizens, and strengthens multilateralism 
and EU’s role model in the world. EU citizens take their 
rightful destiny into their hands. Third county young ed-
ucated people goes to EU to taste freedom more than 
make profit. The EU sets global agendas such as the UN 
Conference on the Future of the Planet beyond 2050. 
The EU renews multilateralism and constructively chal-
lenges other key players to deliver, which strengthens 
global partnerships and collaboration. Ultimately, the 
EU secures its open strategic autonomy, renews multi-
lateralism and constructively challenges other key play-
ers to deliver.
Geopolitical assumptions for expected and 
desired EU’s open strategic autonomy 
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic autono-
my geopolitical expectations in 2040 identified via the 
online survey can be summarised as: ‘the EU becomes 
a hard power with an independent defence/security ca-
pacity and able to shape trade and alliances according 
to its principles, but in 2040 remains its status quo po-
sition globally’. Its building blocks are: 
• The EU is able to build required alliances and part-
nerships whilst maintaining its underlying values
• China’s geopolitical power still growing 
• The EU will have to develop its own defence force
The EU has a flexible defence mechanism and an overall 
stronger hard power with an independent EU joint de-
fence/security capability. The EU becomes Federal and 
speaks with one voice, allowing it to firmly protect its 
interest and develop solid and beneficial partnerships 
around the globe. The vision of an integrated European 
continent, with increased EU competences and indepen-
dent MS, with a collective strategy and agreement on required individual actions, with a clear EU governance 
scheme, and with EU’s open strategic autonomy enhanc-
ing MS capacities for action against foreign competitors, 
has therefore been achieved. The EU has an effective 
and independent defence capability, and its hard power 
supports its interests, while keeping its alliances.
There is a shift from multilateralism to bilateralism and 
regionalism. The EU is able to negotiate and establish 
trade with world leaders like US and China according 
to its values and interests. Asian markets surge accu-
mulating capital and driving innovation leading to an 
economic hegemony of the Asian countries. America is 
fighting internally to set their global role, shifting be-
tween self-isolation and striving for global leadership. 
Africa has more leverage in international institutions af-
ter a few political revolutions. Europe strives for global 
competitiveness and to break away from saturated in-
ternal markets, but is still hindered by coherence. There-
fore, the EU has a greater geopolitical focus on regional 
issues rather than focusing on its international role.
Climate change and humanitarian aid together with grey 
conflicts, including disinformation, cyber and proxy wars, 
becomes the source of conflicts between states and re-
gions, thus reducing democracy and forcing the rise of 
new power blocks. These rewrite the global governance 
rulebook and redefine the balance of global power thus 
increasing general instability. However, global challeng-
es and crisis, migration due to climate change, wars 
and economic inequalities, and other source of conflicts 
force countries to collaborate and look towards com-
mon solutions, with military spending continuing but 
more focused on local conflicts. To achieve a new bal-
ance, regional power blocks are formed, with the EU and 
the US forming an alliance to counterbalance the eco-
nomic power and geopolitical influence of Asian coun-
tries, especially China, as well as a global reduction in 
the number and level of democracy.  
Open Strategic Autonomy enables the EU to shape al-
liances and trade according to its interests, but glob-
al competition and economic powers lead to Europe 
maintaining its current global position in 2040.  For the 
EU, strategic autonomy is crucial for the energy sec-
tor (less dependency from Russia), and for balancing 
the achievement of climate targets with the synergis-
tic role of energy storage technologies. Open strategic 
autonomy will lead to the adoption of QMV in external 
relations. Internet regionalization with IT governance 
88
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND(e.g. interoperability standardization and Internet gover-
nance) becomes crucial for USA and China competition. 
Some regions and countries are completely left behind. 
The EU has maintained at least its current status quo.
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic autono-
my geopolitical desires in 2040 can be summarised as: 
‘the EU is seen as the leader of the free world and acts 
as a global broker for peace and cooperation due to a 
reliable soft and hard power’. Its building blocks are: 
• Democracy and human rights remain relevant
• The EU will have to develop its own defence force 
(same as  A8)
• The EU will remain a space power
Europe builds a strong and competitive space capability. 
This happens with the EU is facing harsh competition in 
the space sector (US, China, Russia, India), and with its in-
vestment capacities still lagging behind those of the US. 
But this trend is reversed in 2040 and Europe has man-
aged to develop strong threat detection capacities and a 
European base of secure communications satellites.
In 2040 the EU is taken more seriously by other world 
powers because it is a reliable soft and hard power. The 
EU has the rapid decision-making assets to robustly 
guard its interests. The EU has finally developed a hard 
power edge that supports its interests, while keeping its 
alliances in 2040. 
The EU has finally developed an effective, strong and in-
dependent joint defence and security capability. The EU 
is moving closer to a stronger European Defence Union 
that will ensure EU citizens’ security. This, of course, re-
quires additional investments at EU level. But the EU has 
been able to gain further influence on the international 
scene thanks to economic growth and the attractive-
ness of its social, environmental and economic model. 
The EU is on par with the major centres of geopolitical 
power and recognized as the leader of the free world. 
At the same time, the EU is strong in trade and peace 
making missions as well as a development partner. It 
has a sufficient number of strong equally-partners and 
regional leaders around the world. This enables multi-
lateralism to be the preferred forum for discussion, and 
the military dimension to be less prominent in diplomat-
ic relations.
Europe is seen as a reference at global level for de-
mocracy, values and human rights, filling the gap left by the US and China. The world has more stability through 
renewed engagement in multilateral processes, and the 
EU speaks with one voice. The collaboration among na-
tions to tackle global challenges will decrease military 
spending and the number of conflicts.
The EU has achieved at a kind of “smart continent spe-
cialisation” and acts as a global broker for peace and 
cooperation. The EU leads the global scene to find com-
promises between regional powers (effort on norms and 
standards) and defend democracy and values. The EU 
co-lead the IT standardization process, along with the 
US and China. There is a peaceful cooperation between 
major power centres, with a more a democratic China, 
and the EU taking the lead in human rights and envi-
ronmental issues. Ultimately, in 2040 there is a total 
balance of global powers. There are synergies and glo-
balisation, instead of conflict and antagonism.
Economic assumptions for expected and de-
sired EU’s open strategic autonomy 
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic autono-
my economic expectations in 2040 identified via the on-
line survey can be summarised as: ‘the EU maintains its 
economic strength in absolute terms but not in relative 
terms to others, resulting in increased protectionism 
and a struggle to recover and prosper, thus being un-
able to materialise its vision of economic sovereignty’. 
Its building blocks are: 
• The EU remains a stable Union 
• Food security is challenged for Europeans 
• The EU is not able to respond timely to challenges
A strong geopolitical EU facilitates the development of 
all domains of the EU economy, which feeds back into 
strengthening its geopolitical position, in a positive feed-
back loop. This is also key for the EU to remain among 
the highest income per capita regions of the world, and 
therefore uphold itself in global multilateral economic 
system that delivers for Europeans. Likewise, a strong 
geopolitical Europe reinforces and depends of the euro 
as a global currency, as well as to remove barriers to the 
common market.
In 2040, global capital is accumulated in a limited num-
ber of countries, such as China, which drives off com-
petition. Developed countries maintained their current 
state of growth of 1% to 2% per year (OECD countries). 
89However, inflation in Europe puts the euro to a test. Chi-
na leads even while having dramatically slowed down 
its growth, which in turn is accelerating in sub-Saharan 
Africa. At the same time, the Digital Economy becomes 
more and more the engine of developed countries.
In this context, digital market dependencies hampers 
the EU economic progress and net export position. EU’s 
industry dependence on raw materials makes EU prod-
ucts and goods more and more expensive. Moreover, in 
spite of the 5 leading economies in 2020 have increased 
their economic and financial power and concentration, in 
2040 the EU has reduced its overall net export position, 
including in the food and agricultural sector. In fact, the 
EU has maintained its economic strength in absolute 
terms but lost in relative terms to other regions.
The EU had its competition law acquis reformed with 
a protectionist twist. In trying to change its economic 
positioning, the EU has strengthened its tools and mon-
itoring of foreign investments, and has focused its ef-
forts on securing a European supply chain. This resulted 
in increased protectionism, while facing continuously 
growing competition from Asia. 
The EU and the world are still struggling to recover and 
prosper, with Europe being unable to fulfil its vision of 
economic sovereignty. In light of the EU recovery neces-
sary after COVID-19, the enforcement of trade agree-
ments has not always been feasible and those with ac-
cess to the internal market of the EU have not always 
complied with the EU standards and rules. Ultimately, 
Europe has not been able to materialise its own vision 
around economic sovereignty, while maintaining close 
ties with the US and China, both of which have decou-
pled from one another.
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic auton-
omy economic desires in 2040 can be summarised as: 
‘investments in innovation, people and the planet cou-
pled with internal coordination leads to EU economic 
prosperity and resilience, as well as the eradication of 
global poverty, with the euro becoming the global cur-
rency’. Its building blocks are: 
• The EU will generate power to pay for its objectives
• The euro is around in 20 years
Major investments in innovation, people and the envi-
ronment led to stronger trade and investment links and 
capacity. The EU created new and quality jobs, fuelled 
by diversified and open supply chains and a strong man-ufacturing base. The creation of innovative legal tools 
such as the carbon border adjustment mechanism and 
the digital levy are fully operational and effective in pro-
tecting the Single Market from foreign unfair practices 
and in bolstering European industries. Furthermore, the 
EU Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) have become 
the blueprint for future European initiatives in investing 
in multi-country projects that promote European value 
added in line with the European open strategic autonomy. 
Industry alliances leverage EU’s global economic hedge. 
Collaboration between the EU, Member States and in-
dustries is as intense as ever, across all strategic value 
chains. The existing industry alliances, bringing togeth-
er industrial actors, SMEs, public authorities at national 
and regional levels and NGOs in key areas, such as bat-
teries, raw materials and hydrogen, have been further 
reinforced. New industry alliances in other strategic ar-
eas have been developed.
The EU has a cohesive economic development based 
on internal solidarity and external strength. The EU has 
managed to deal with some of its critical dependencies 
(energy, digital, industrial). It has also improved its ca-
pacity to defend itself from Russia and other regional 
powers. There is overall more solidarity in the bloc. The 
EU’s economy has seized the opportunities from green-
ing and digitization, and is competitive in relation to all 
major benchmark. In fact, the Digital Economy outdoes 
the traditional one in the whole EU.
The EU’s economy works for people and planet. The EU is 
still among the highest income per capita regions of the 
world In 2040. The global multilateral economic system 
that the EU upholds still delivers for Europeans. In fact, 
the EU asserts itself as an economic superpower and 
uses that power for a more sustainable development and 
an increased quality life both in the Union and the global 
world. Products and services quality wins over quantity. 
As a result, the euro becomes the global currency.
EU territorial balance, coordination and coherence is fi-
nally reached. Member states national economies man-
age to find a fair balance between each other at the 
global and EU level. Coordination actions among MS 
enables Europe to reach a balance between the market 
and social and environment values. The EU economy is 
resilient to shocks (such as COVID-19), which in contrast 
enables the EU to play a decisive role in supporting sus-
tainable development in Africa. Ultimately, this enables 
an economic growth that benefits all, and leads to the 
eradication of global poverty.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDSocial assumptions for expected and desired EU’s open 
strategic autonomy 
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic autono-
my social expectations in 2040 identified via the online 
survey can be summarised as: ‘in spite of increasing in -
equalities and digital divide, which lead to social and ter-
ritorial fragmentation and has put democracy to a test, in 
2040 the EU remains the world champion for quality of 
life and inclusion’. Its building blocks are: 
• Income inequality leads to instability 
• Europeans deserve prosperity
n 2040, there has been an increase of the digital divide, 
including in terms of infrastructures, skills and compe-
tencies, between rich and poor countries. The divide be-
tween technically skilled end educated and those lacking 
these competences have exacerbated, with the middle 
class in Europe and in the US continuing to increase 
their distance with respect to the richest. Teleworking 
has fuelled social tension and delocalization of work, 
thus curbing the development of new ideas. There has 
been a reduction of working time by 1/10 on a global 
scale leading to more independent workers with limited 
social protection.
Europe’s inadequate focus and investment in the devel-
opment of digital capacities lead to increased social and 
territorial fragmentation. Continued polarisation and 
growing digital divide have further ignited ‘alternative 
facts’ and conspiracy theories. These continue to pose 
serious risks. There is an overall scepticism towards sci-
ence and democratic systems. Moreover, unemployment 
remains the key challenge against high social and la-
bour rights’ expectations putting pressure on Europe’s 
competitiveness. At the same time, ‘the establishment’ 
and ‘world order’ continues, while increasing inequali-
ties persist.
The inequality gap within societies and between 
countries expands. Inequalities in Europe are still 
less compared to the Americas, but worse than in 
2021. There is a growing dissatisfaction of citizens, 
which leads to growing social unrest, which in turn 
shapes governance models. Democratic values are 
tested in various parts of the world. Immature ‘de-
mocracies’ experience some form of ‘democracy-an-
archy-tyranny’ cycle.
The EU remains the world “quality of life” champion in 
2040. In striving for geopolitical and economic global leadership, in 2040 Europe is able to implement the 
most progressive and far-reaching social-economic pol-
icies in the world, as well as to impose strong social 
standards to any company willing to operate in the EU 
market. Social disparities begins to be bridged through 
a functioning social safety net. However, there is still 
a high level of unemployment amongst non-qualified 
people. At the same time, EU legal migrants (which are 
the large majority of migrants) are integrated as part of 
the European way of life. Overall, the EU society becomes 
increasingly mixed and social matters (employment, eq-
uity, fairness, etc.) is prominent in the social debate.
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic au-
tonomy social desires in 2040 can be summarised as: 
‘investments in (re)skilling and innovation led to a dy-
namic, mobile and competitive workforce, with Europe 
achieving work-life balance, social equality, health se-
curity and increased quality of life for all’. Its building 
blocks are: 
• Quality of life depends on good health, innovation and 
skills
• It will be possible to reinforce the resilience of critical 
supply chains (such as pharma) even in a globalized 
world
• The EU will not have any mass migration 
EU’s open strategic autonomy leads to increased security 
and safety. It enabled the efficient and effective coordi-
nation of health policies among Member States towards 
unexpected sanitary crises. Europe is now able to react 
quickly to health threats with the help of a diversified 
and secure pharmaceutical supply chain. Given the in-
extricable link between the pharmaceutical industry and 
manufacturing dependencies, Europe has embarked on 
renewed investment efforts in order to bolster manufac-
turing capacities for certain APIs and medicines.
The EU has invested sufficiently in training, innovation 
and entrepreneurship serving a dynamic, mobile and 
competitive workforce. EU agreements on social protec-
tion (e.g. working time, minimum wages, social securi-
ty) has led to better protection of independent work-
ers and a decrease of working time thanks to AI and 
continuous technological and economic progress. Work-
life balance based on individual needs and desires is 
achieved. Moreover, the EU is taking a leading position 
in the eradication of poverty globally, while internally it 
has become a memory.
91The EU has overcome its inner divide and has found 
internal consensus on thorny issues, such as immigra-
tion (not least due to its geopolitical autonomy to take 
action). There is common understanding and accep-
tance of certain fundamental ‘truths’ and values. As a 
consequence, middle class repositions itself and social 
inequality is reduced. Migration is reduced. Cities keep 
on thriving as centres for innovation and exchange of 
ideas. At the same time, growth in cities slows down 
while suburban areas increase their services and work 
opportunities. Overall, social and generational digital 
divide has been dramatically reduced, in the whole EU 
and worldwide.
The EU remains the world “quality of life” champion 
in 2040. There is a renewed commitment to solidar-
ity both internally and externally. EU legal migrants 
(which are again the large majority of migrants) are 
integrated as part of the European societies. Further-
more, developing societies have closed the income 
gap with the wealthiest ones, while in Europe there 
has been an eradication of social inequalities. The EU 
is also the champion of tax equity and social equalities 
in the world. Young Europeans do not need or wish to 
emigrate outside the block.
Environmental assumptions for expected and desired 
EU’s open strategic autonomy 
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic auton-
omy environmental expectations in 2040 identified via 
the online survey can be summarised as: ‘environmental 
degradation and biodiversity loss increase while R&I in-
vestments are not enough to deploy required solutions 
to climate change and ecological tipping points – on the 
one hand, this leads to Europe’s inability to achieve its 
2030 climate targets; on the other hand, it also leads 
to environmental matters playing an increasing role 
in shaping EU’s open strategic autonomy, with Europe 
emerging stronger in 2040 for setting new targets and 
monitoring mechanisms, and to lead by example’. Its 
building block is: 
• Climate change will remain a global challenge
• Environmental and pandemic crises will likely 
change the geopolitical situation we have today
Current environmental degradation continued and ac-
celerated towards 2040. The major positive effect of 
COVID-19 was a momentarily cut down CO2 emissions, 
mainly due to reduction of transport. Reduction of emis-sions happened in India, the US and Latin America. At 
the same time, climate change intensified leading to 
extreme climatic events and the reduction of biodiver-
sity, in particular in Africa due to increased competition 
for spaces. Climate refugees augmented towards 2040. 
Moreover, a slower economy and a focus in fighting the 
global crisis with a short-term outlook has led to slowing 
down the pace of R&I contributing to fight climate change. 
EU climate-related R&I investments still lag behind those 
of the US and China. According to current estimations, 
the EU invests €7.5 billion per year in climate-related 
R&D, less than the USA with €12 billion, or China with 
€8.6 billion. This investment gap has not been bridged 
by 2040. This phenomenon was aggravated in the after-
math of the pandemic, due to the volatility of the mar-
ket and increased uncertainties, which the EU was not 
able to anticipate and act upon accordingly. Therefore, 
industries were reluctant to invest in ground-breaking, 
environmentally-friendly solutions for the reduction of 
CO2 emissions, especially since these were perceived to 
come at a high cost. 
In 2040, focusing on the sustainability of the planet be-
come the new global paradigm. The magnitude of disas-
ters and humanitarian crises due to climate change have 
almost doubled in the last 20 years. The emptying the 
cities due to spread teleworking in the aftermath of fight-
ing the COVID-19 crisis increased the impact on soil seal-
ing and loss of biodiversity. Several regions of the world 
became depopulated due to desertification and flooding, 
while other regions remained nature sanctuaries. 
In this context, in 2040 environmental matters play an 
increasing role in all the other open strategic autonomy 
dimensions. The world is getting greener, but we will not 
reach the 1.5oC target for climate change. Adaptation to 
climate change is the new norm. Rich countries benefit 
from clean air, water and soil, often at the detriment of 
underdeveloped countries (and continents). The planet is 
divided into the clean and the dirty world. The battle for 
resources has increased, including water and minerals.
Europe does not achieve its 2030 targets and is unlikely 
to achieve those set for 2050, but is overall stronger to 
fight climate change and to lead by example. In striving 
for geopolitical and economic global leadership the EU 
has been able to implement the most ambitious and ef-
fective environmental policy, finding several solutions to 
climate challenges, thereby compelling other countries 
to follow. The EU was able to impose strong environ-
92
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDmental standards to any company willing to operate in 
the EU market with an extra-territorial effect. However, 
despite the progress made along the way, the EU still 
did not achieve its 2030 objectives. But in 2040 the 
EU continues to lead by example on the green agen-
da. Technological development allowed environmental 
threats in the EU to decrease. Nevertheless and in spite 
of having made big strides towards greening the econ-
omy, the EU will not be able to reach its 2050 climate 
targets either. Overall, 20 years later the Green Deal 
passes the “cost-benefit” test and enables the EU to 
set new achievable targets for the next 20 to 50 years. 
Copernicus play an important role in the monitoring of 
the new targets and in enabling the EU to become a 
stronger player; and Europe remains the top place in the 
world for both pensioners and youth.
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic autono-
my environmental desires in 2040 can be summarised 
as: ‘the EU is at the forefront of disaster prevention and 
humanitarian aid when it comes to environmental risks, 
pushing a working global agreement to preserve and re-
spect nature and regenerate ecosystems services, as well 
as to achieve climate neutrality with clean air, water and 
soil for all’. Its building blocks are: 
• The EU will be able to manage increased risks/di-
sasters/impacts connected to climate change (= A4)
• Natural resources (land and sea based, water) re-
main sufficient to ensure Europe’s security
Through innovation and adaptability of its labour force 
the EU has managed to reduce energy dependency to-
wards foreign players while projecting its values. The 
“smart” revolution of our industry, space (i.e. Copernicus) 
and society, enabled by the digital transformation, has 
significantly improved EU’s environmental sustainability. 
The EU is progressing on its roadmap towards climate 
neutrality while enjoying the cleanest environment in 
the developed world.
The European Green Deal strategy has produced its ex-
pected effects, in Europe and worldwide, thus passing 
the “cost-benefit” test. The EU’s green deal has made 
Europe independent from oil and gas supply from prob-
lematic regions. Hence, Europe has addressed over-de-
pendencies on foreign actors for scarce raw materials 
and energy. Also, the EU has set binding targets and 
indicators towards resource use efficiency and the ex-
istence of recyclable and reparable products on the EU 
market. In a nutshell, EU’s efforts towards decarboni-sation and modernisation of its industry is on the right 
track towards achieving the 2050 climate targets. 
Europe is seen as reference at global level in protect-
ing the environment and fighting climate change. The 
EU is at the forefront of disaster prevention and hu-
manitarian aid when it comes to environmental risks. 
It pushes a working global agreement to preserve and 
respect nature and the environment, as well as achieve 
climate neutrality.
Developed economies have reduced the pressure on 
natural resources of over-consumption. This has led to 
a drastic reduction of emissions at global scale. New 
technological solutions to produce energy have been 
developed leading to increased efficiency of renewables 
and the first tangible results in nuclear fusion. Urban 
densification is fostered leaving preserved areas for bio-
diversity, and regenerating previously destroyed ecosys-
tem services. Overall, the fight against climate change 
has been won and full circular economies around the 
world thrive with clean air, water and soil for all.
Technological assumptions for expected and 
desired EU’s open strategic autonomy 
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic autono-
my technological expectations in 2040 identified via the 
online survey can be summarised as: ‘the EU is leading 
on green technologies and regulations, and is on the 
way to building technological supremacy via creativity 
and a cutting-edge R&I policy; however, the EU still lags 
behind in innovation on digital and other competitive 
technologies due to missed opportunities, brain drain 
and timing required for achieving consensus, as well as 
due to the lack of natural resources and IPR’. Its building 
blocks are: 
• The EU remains a regulatory superpower
• China remains one country
Geopolitical and economic global leadership allow the 
EU to implement an ambitious, cutting-edge R&I poli-
cy, which steadily lead the way towards technological 
supremacy. China will reach the levels of R&I of Europe 
and the U.S. However, in the absence of democracy, Chi-
nese innovations will reach a limit, well below the ca-
pacities of Europe and the US. Africa and Latin America 
will keep on lagging behind. Globally, AI and digital inno-
vation may prevail and limit innovation in other sectors, 
such as those related to environment.
93The EU will be a leader in green technology and in regu-
lations. The EU has set the benchmark for regulation of 
information technology, but not made enough progress 
in building up its own IT infrastructure and industry. 
Artificial intelligence made 1/10 of existing jobs irrel-
evant. The EU has established its own ICANN and DNS 
resolver. The cyber-physical interaction has replaced 
most of the present physical interactions. 6G and glob-
al satellite Internet have disrupted the Internet as we 
knew it in 2021. 
The EU is the most technologically creative region of the 
world in relation to new technologies: from research to 
markets, a success story. Technological breakthroughs 
continue changing the overall picture in unforeseen 
ways. Data localisation might have become a (dystopi-
an) reality in 2040. The single market for data enables 
European data to be processed and stored in Europe, 
thus leading to a severe blow to cross-border data flows 
and digital trade. Likewise, communications are more 
integrated and there are new, green forms of energy. 
Technology advances happened in all fronts, transport, 
medicine, basic sciences, communications, etc. 
However, the EU is still lagging behind in the devel-
opment of competitive technologies. This happens in 
spite of its creativity and of having developed ambi-
tious regulations on digital technologies and on con-
sumers’ protection. Ethical issues related to technology 
and a difficult relationship between man and machine 
(the spectrum of a Brave New World) is common-
place. Digitalisation is a normal part of daily life. Eu-
rope leads technological innovation on several fronts, 
but finds it increasingly difficult to compete, especially 
with Asia. This is because Europe followed a conser-
vative approach and focused on established markets 
and products. This led to missed opportunities. Global 
competitors took the risk and developed new products/
solutions and created new markets that are gradually 
displacing the traditional ones. In addition, the number 
of researchers in Europe is smaller than that of China 
and the US, and the EU is a net exporter of PhDs, thus 
further reducing technological capabilities in Europe. 
Furthermore, harnessing new technologies requires 
fast responses and the EU is driven by consensus and 
suffers from internal divisions. Strong states in the EU 
have become even stronger in 2040.
Europe, although sophisticated, is unable to leverage 
technology effectively due to its dependency on key re-
sources and capabilities. Intellectual property rights are controlled by a handful number of firms and countries. 
The space industry is controlled by private enterpris-
es and is not driven by nation states or regions any-
more. Likewise, very few countries have the monopoly 
of key materials and resources required to build cur-
rent (2040) and next generation technological products 
(digital and green technologies).
The assumptions regarding EU’s open strategic auton-
omy technological desires in 2040 can be summarised 
as: ‘human-centric and ethical, disruptive and evolving 
technologies developed through a boost of R&I invest-
ment in Europe enables negative impact on ecosys-
tems, biodiversity and natural resources to subside as 
well as EU competitiveness and citizens quality of life 
to increase for all’. Its building blocks are: 
In technology regulation Europe strikes the right bal-
ance between industrial competitiveness and protec-
tion of EU citizens
Digital society has a rights based and fair fundament
The EU has more control over its data, private public 
and industrial. Its space infrastructures are secure and 
kept up with progress. The EU is autonomous and in-
teroperable with the global satellite internet technol-
ogy. The Cyber-Physical revolution also has already 
happened. Overall, the EU has increased technological 
non-dependence for critical areas to ensure its security/
defence, including in space and digital technologies.
Investment in research and innovation goes up to 
4-5% in all EU Member States, which have more ef-
fective take up into the market. The EU has invested 
sufficiently in research and innovation to develop com-
petitive digital solutions (i.e. platforms and services) 
and secure data sharing / usage serving its citizens and 
consumers’ interests. There is an increased investment 
in technologies coupled with social awareness of their 
implications. 
The approach to technology development is hu-
man-centric. In other words, technology is developed 
aiming at increasing citizens’ quality of life, such as in 
health. The EU is the most technologically creative re-
gion of the world, with new technological developments 
going from research to markets successfully. Such a 
success is possible because the EU rules the regulatory 
and industrial technology complex.
94
SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDMoreover, a robust, harmonised ethical framework for AI 
and disruptive technologies across Europe enables it to 
boost innovation and industrial competitiveness without 
imposing additional regulatory burdens on SMEs. How-
ever, due to the unpredictable and incessant evolution 
of AI, Europe must remain vigilant in anticipating future 
technological developments via flexible, malleable legal 
mechanisms.
Technological progress aims at people and planet’s 
improvement and is accessible to the majority of the 
citizens in the world. Overall, new technological devel-
opments and artificial intelligence facilitates daily life, 
reduces working time and minimises our ecological 
footprint on the planet. It also enables the development 
of new sources of energy. Sustainable energy and trans-
port solutions become affordable in all cities, which of-
fer improved quality of life and an excellent work-living 
balance. New technologies allow increased quality of 
life for all and ultimately to regenerate the planet itself. 
Final assumptions used for developing and exploring 
scenarios for the EU standing in 2040
The above 29 assumptions were brought for discussion 
in a workshop with the open strategic autonomy work-
ing group (Figure A-1). The aim was to check how far 
participants identified themselves with these initial as-
sumptions and to unlock further assumptions within the 
group. Other 20 assumptions were jointly identified, as 
outlined below.
Geopolitical assumptions:
Institutional bias towards believing in win-win solutions 
when trade-offs may be unavoidable
Europe has tools to respond effectively to crisis in EU 
neighbourhood
The EU is still there in 20 years
The EU remains dependent on the US for its security
An enlarged EU has adopted yet more fragile deci-
sion-making procedures in a number of policies, leading 
to blockage
Global institutions remain weakened
No more Brexit-type operations
African countries foreign policy will balance between 
China and the EUForeign political systems remain stable
The rule of law is credible in the EU
There are no major war involving Europe
Military budgets used for greater goods than (artificial) 
sense of security
Economic assumptions:
Growth can be sustainable in a finite economic system
Supply chains remain organised globally
There are institutions of global economic governance
Technological assumptions:
Science based policy-making prevails
Social assumptions:
There will (still) be a common narrative citizens believe 
that will provide the needed support for the costs of 
action
Nationalism remains strong
Environmental assumptions:
2050 climate goals need to be met
Society remains highly dependent on raw materials and 
energy
95What assumptions are we making about the future standing of the EU in 2040 that perhaps should be challenged by the scenarios? What 
biases might we have?

972 Annex 2 – Online Delphi 
Introduction
The Online Delphi represents a public online platform, 
developed under the umbrella of the EU Survey, by the 
Competence Centre on Foresight of the Joint Research 
Centre, at the European Commission, in cooperation 
with IT corporate teams.
The Delphi method is a structured expert survey used 
to gather opinions on different possible developments 
in the long-term future on a given topic563 . It represents 
one of the methodologies used by the foresight com-
munity to gather collective intelligence about the future. 
It also serves to create consensus on a specific topic 
and quantify assumptions regarding the future. With-
in a specific project, the Online Delphi can complement 
the qualitative approach offered by other foresight tools 
and methods. 
Initially administrated by post, the advantage of today’s 
Online Delphi is that the results are displayed immedi-
ately after each entry, so that the participants can see 
how the assessments evolve and change their previous 
evaluation if they chose to do so. Additionally, the re-
spondents can return as many times as they want (with-
in a specific period) to see how the responses evolve, as 
well as to change their own entries, if they wish so, and 
comment other answers. This removed the need to run 
different rounds of the survey for experts to reassess 
and justify their answers based on the results from pre-
vious rounds. Moreover, respondents can choose what 
to answer and what not to. The Online Delphi is com-
pletely anonymous. 
The Online Delphi on open strategic autonomy was 
structured in three parts: 
1. The main part (Part I) included 50 statements 
about the future and EU’s open strategic auton-
omy, structured into five open strategic autono-
my dimensions derived from the literature review 
and the scenarios: Geopolitics, Economy, Society, 
Environment, Technology. For each of these state-
ments, the respondents were asked to assess the 
following 4 criteria:  
Impact of the statement on achieving Open Strategic 
Autonomy in the EU
Urgency of the EU to act on the statement
Capacity of the EU to act on the statement
Likelihood of the occurrence of the statement by 2040The second part (Part II) included a quantitative 
matrix mapping EU’s dependencies and capacities 
in relation to open strategic autonomy. 
2. The third part (Part III) included six open questions 
to complement dependencies and capacities.

Participants statistics
The survey was launched on March 18th, 2021 and re-
mained open until April 5th, 2021. By that date, 241 
people had answered, of which 92.16% were from an 
EU country and the rest from outside EU. The most 
represented professional categories were European in-
stitutions (33.73%), Government (23.53%), Academia 
(11.37%), Civil society (8.63%), and Business (7.45), as 
indicated in the table. 
Respondents were also asked to assess their level of 
familiarity with the five open strategic autonomy di-
mensions. As we can observe from the graph below the 
majority of the respondents considered themselves to 
be “Familiar” and “Knowledgeable” with open strategic 
autonomy in each of the five dimensions. 
The highest level of expertise can be found in the case 
of the respondents to statements from Technologies, 
Geopolitics and Environment. Expertise for the Social 
dimension is assessed the lowest of all five dimensions.

Overall results Part I     
The first part of the Online Delphi survey was designed 
to allow an in-depth understanding of the key priorities 
required to shape and secure EU’s open strategic auton-
omy by 2040. Priorities have been identified based on 
the judgment of experts of all fifty (50) statements (10 
per open strategic autonomy dimension). Each statement 
was assessed via four criteria, which are highlighted be-
low. All statements judged relevant at either extreme 
of each criteria (higher/lower impact, higher/lower ur-
gency, higher/lower capacity, and high/low likelihood of 
occurrence) were analysed in greater detail. These were 
brought to the fore (Tables X to Z below) to enable a port-
folio analysis of statements that are relevant to shape 
and secure EU’s open strategic autonomy by 2040 in a 
combination of at least two or more criteria:Impact of the statement on achieving open strategic 
autonomy in the EU
Urgency of the EU to act on the statement
Capacity of the EU to act on the statement
Likelihood of the occurrence of the statement by 2040
Tables X to Z below depict the most relevant statements 
for each open strategic autonomy dimension, according 
to both extremes in the four applied criteria.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDOverall results Part II
Asked to assess the EU’s position in the supply chain 
for several technologies in 2040, respondents are main-
ly divided between two camps. One majority considers 
that EU’s position could be “strong/very strong” regard-
ing several technologies, while almost the same number 
of respondents take a “neutral” position regarding other 
technologies. EU’s position is considered to be “weak” 
only regarding two supply chains. 
The respondents of the Online Delphi are positive about 
EU’s strong and very strong future position in the supply 
chain for the following technologies: batteries, low-car-
bon mobility, smart grids, renewable energy, robotics, 
automation and machine learning, Internet of Things, 
health diagnosis and treatment. 
A second large majority prefers to stay “neutral” regard-
ing: hydrogen, drones, 3D printing, semiconductors and 
chips, cloud and quantum computing, 5G/6G, virtual re-
ality, cryptocurrency and blockchain. 
At the same time, there are four supply chains consid-
ered to be strong/very strong by some, but fall under 
“neutral” for other respondents. These are: AI, big data 
analysis, gene editing and bio-engineering, convergence 
of bio-, nano- and information technology. 
On the contrary, EU’s future position could be weak for 
space exploration and military supply chains. 
Asked to outline which region will dominate the same 
technologies in 2040, the answers that we received 
clarify the position of respondents towards the four 
supply chains in which EU’s position could be “strong/
very strong” or questionable, doubtable, unknown (“neu-
tral” position).
All respondents taking a neutral position have chosen 
the US as the top region which will dominate in AI, big 
data analysis, gene editing and bio-engineering, con-
vergence of bio-, nano- and information technology in 
2040. If for gene editing and bio-engineering, conver-
gence of bio-, nano- and information technology, Europe 
is closely following the US, China represents the second 
dominator regarding AI and big data analysis (Europe 
occupies the third position). 
Regarding the two technologies where EU’s position is 
considered weak in 2040 – space exploration and mil-
itary – the leading region is the US, with China being a 
very distant second. The overall results emphasize: 
1. Top five technologies that the EU should invest in 
today in terms of R&D and production to build its 
open strategic autonomy; 
2. Five most relevant sectors for EU’s open strategic 
autonomy in 2040;

109Overall results Part III     
The insights provided via the open questions were or-
ganised in terms of EU strengths (i.e. capacities, capa-
bilities and both soft and hard power) and weaknesses 
(i.e. dependencies vulnerabilities and risks).
EU weaknesses: 
The survey results confirmed a number of areas we had 
already identified, such as the risk of growing depen-
dencies on raw materials for manufacturing, as well as 
hardware and digital infrastructure, in particular from 
China.  
Results from the survey have also reiterated the EU’s 
future dependence on foreign talents (labour force) as 
a consequence of demography trends such as ageing 
population and overall population decline. 
Other existing and potential future dependencies sig-
nalled in the survey concern advanced technologies 
(from US and China), AI and software (in particular from 
the US), robotics (in particular from Japan) and energy 
security if the EU does not gear its green energy transi-
tion towards greater autonomy. Lack of EU control over 
critical trade routes, like the Panama or Suez canals, or 
emerging new routes, was also mentioned.
EU strengths:
The most important horizontal capacity that was 
stressed by a number of survey responses is human 
capital, the investment in a skilled work force amidst 
global competition and rapidly changing labour market. 
In particular, fields mentioned where more skills are 
needed include AI, Big Data, genetics, cyber, robotics 
and STEM generally. In relation to human capital, better 
talent management was also signalled, for the EU to 
attract global talent. 
Apart from that, respondents stressed research and in-
novation, the application of cutting edge technologies 
and AI, renewables and climate change mitigation and 
adaptation, space and defence technologies and food 
security.
In terms of social capacities, the survey underlines the 
importance of ensuring social support and building trust 
among people and institutions to achieve EU’s open 
strategic autonomy. Emphasis here is on democracy, ac-
cepting diversity in all forms, promoting a human-cen-
tred approach to technologies and digital society, and 
promoting sustainability. The need for more vocal and coherent EU diplomacy, as a vehicle to promote and 
defend EU values and responsible leadership, was also 
mentioned as an important capacity.  
A number of responses to the open questions stress the 
need for EU leadership in human-centred approach to 
technologies. The ethical use of Artificial Intelligence, 
as a general purpose technology, features particular-
ly highly in survey responses, as does the ethical use 
of data and date protection. Other technologies where 
continued or greater EU leadership is called for is in 
quantum technologies, biotechnology, and low-carbon 
technologies, especially in mobility. 
Finally, other survey replies stress the EU’s continued 
global leadership in mitigating climate change and 
strengthening its global commitment to supporting and 
managing socio-economic green transitions, improving 
crisis management, including in the area of climate mi-
gration, addressing global health challenges, and pro-
motion of human rights.

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYONDReferences and endnotes
1  COM (2021) 66 final open strategic autonomy emphasises the EU’s ability to make its own choices and shape the world around it 
through leadership and engagement, reflecting its strategic interests a nd values. COM (2021) 350 final emphasises on open strategic 
autonomy to deal with dependencies.
2  Strategic foresight draws useful insights for strategic planning, policymaking and preparedness (European Commission, 2017, 
Strategic Foresight Primer). It is not about predicting the future but ab out exploring different plausible futures that could arise and the 
opportunities and challenges they could present. It involves identifying trends and emerging issues, using them to create scenarios, 
visions and associated pathways to make better decisions and act in the present in order to shape the future we want (https://www.
sciencedirect.com/book/9780128225967/science-for-policy-handbook).
3  The five areas mirror the STEEP categories (societal, technologica l, economic, environmental, political) that are widely used in 
systematic foresight analysis. The political category is in this report specified with ‘geopolitics’ to better address the specificities of 
open strategic autonomy. In the 2020 Strategic Foresight Report of the Commission (European Commission (2020) Strategic Foresight 
– Charting The Course Towards A More Resilient Europe. COM/2020/493 final) analysed resilience enhancing policies across four areas: 
social and economic resilience, geopolitical resilience, green resilience and digital resilience. These are another adaptation of the 
STEEP concept, according to the specific needs of the resilience analys is in the respective report.

7  The debate also features different terminology and formulations, including strategic autonomy, open strategic autonomy, technological 
or digital sovereignty, innovation sovereignty, strategic sovereignty, and European sovereignty. These different formulations can be 
seen as emphasising different aspects of strategic autonomy, whether openness to cooperation, autonomy from others or capacity to

security, prosperity and sustainable development, based on the promotion of democracy, rule of law, human rights and international 
law. The renewed commitment to the region is inclusive of all partners wishing to cooperate with the EU. The Indo-Pacific region 
represents the world’s economic and strategic centre of gravity. It is home to 60% of the world’s population producing 60% of global 
GDP, contributing two thirds of current global growth. By 2030, the overwhelming majority (90%) of the 2.4 billion new members of 
the middle class entering the global economy will live in the Indo-P acific.” (EEAS, 2021; European Council, 2021).

“Australia’s Quad partnership with India, Japan and the United States brings together four like-minded democracies committed to 
acting in support of an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region with ASEAN at its centre” (AG, 2021). Moreover, “India and 
Australia have common concerns regarding the strategic, security and  environmental challenges in the Indo-Pacific maritime domain. 
They reiterate their commitment to promoting peace, security, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, which is vital for the 
world. As two key Indo-Pacific countries, India and Australia have an enduring interest in a free, open, inclusive and rules based Indo-
Pacific region. They have a shared interest in ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight in the Indo-Pacific region, and maintaining

134  “The roots of the hybrid war debate lie in the characterization o f modern warfare as the integrated use of military force and non-
military activities. The integrated use of military and non-military activities is seen as both a strategic- level threat to Russia, and as 
a tool that can be used in shaping the security environment in accordance with Russia’s strategic interests. Ultimately, hybrid warfare 
can be interpreted as a means of strategic coercion” (Pynnoniemi, 2021).

136  After the US-Russia talk in Geneva on 16 June 2021 the US president said the US would retaliate if Russia continues to carry out 
malicious cyber-attacks against American targets and critical infrastru ctures. Moreover, the two leaders announced a new expert 
US-Russian working group that, amongst other issues, would consult o n the renewal of the Start Three nuclear treaty due to expire in 
2024, and in cybersecurity. Finally, the US has expressed support for Ukraine’s government and claims of opposition backing in Russia 
and neighbouring Belarus, as well as the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe. Areas in which cooperation would be useful include 
Afghanistan, Syria and the Arctic region.

139  According to the Communique issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the NATO meeting in Brussels on 14 
June 2021, “Russia continues to breach the values, principles, trust, and commitments outlined in agreed documents that underpin the 
NATO-Russia relationship... NATO will continue to respond to the deteriorating security environment by enhancing our deterrence and 
defence posture, including by a forward presence in the eastern part of the Alliance... Russia’s growing multi-domain military build-up, 
more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities increasingly threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic 
area and contribute to instability along NATO borders and beyond. Russia’s intensified its hybrid actions target and disrupt critical 
infrastructure in NATO countries” (NATO, 2021).

SHAPING AND SECURING THE EU’S OPEN STRATEGIC AUTONOMY BY 2040 AND BEYOND140  The United States took the decision in December 2019 to create a ‘Space Force’ and in September 2020 France created an ‘Air and 
Space Force’, which followed on from the creation of a Space Command in 2019. Germany too took the decision in September 2020 
to create an ‘Air and Space Operations Centre’. A month later, NATO created its first-ever Space Centre in Germany and in 2021 it was 
decided that France would host the new NATO Centre for Excellence in military space. Additionally, other EU countries such as Italy 
have established space-defence capacities and on 8 March 2021 France started its first-ever military space exercise, Aster X 2021 
(Fiott, 2021).

517  NATO has recently reaffirmed all the decisions, principles and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation stating that 
“working together as an Alliance and with like-minded partners, in particular with the European Union, to protect critical infrastructure, 
strengthen resilience, maintain our technological edge, and address […] challenges to the rules-based international order. The European 
Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO. The NATO-EU strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity 
of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area. NATO recognises the importance of a stronger and more capable European defence. The 
development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint 
efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer. Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance 
our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in 
defence spending. Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance this cooperation. NATO will continue 
to develop and deepen our cooperation by fully implementing the common set of 74 proposals, which contribute to the coherence 
and complementarity of joint efforts. The ongoing distinct strategic processes within NATO and the EU offer a unique opportunity to 
intensify further our consultations and cooperation to enhance the se curity of our citizens and promote peace and stability in the 
Euro-Atlantic area and beyond” (NATO, 2021).

518  In the EU-US Summit, which took place in Brussels on 15 June 2021, there was an agreement to reinvigorate transatlantic trade ties 
and make progress on key files of common interest, including a commitment to uphold the rules-based international order and to: “(i) 
end the COVID-19 pandemic, prepare for future global health challenges, and drive forward a sustainable global recovery; (ii) protect 
our planet and foster green growth; (iii) strengthen trade, investment and technological cooperation; and (iv) build a more democratic, 
peaceful and secure world”. Moreover, they launched a Trade and Technology Council, a forum to coordinate approaches to key global 
trade, economic, and technology issues, and to deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations based on shared democratic values. 
Finally, they re-launched a dedicated bilateral dialogue on China, agreed to establish a high-level dialogue on Russia, and committed 
to launch a dedicated dialogue on security and defence and pursue closer cooperation in this field. (EU-US, 2021).

520  “Europe must lead on the reform and (re)-strengthening of multilateralism in the absence of either US or Chinese leadership on 
this issue. But multilateralism must itself change. It needs to adapt to the growing hybridity in international relations, become less 
organizationally bureaucratic, and correspondingly more open to thos e non-state stakeholders (and the people who populate them) 
invested in its success. A reset multilateral system will require new ru les, or at least reform of the old rules. Preferences emanating 
from long-standing liberal democratic norms still have considerable purchase, and Europe remains a laboratory of multilateralism and 
multi-level governance” (Higgott and Reich, 2020).

522  The EU is already advancing in this direction and is set to announce, together with the US, a wide-ranging partnership around 
technology and trade. This will be done in an attempt to push back against China and promote democratic values, as well as in the 
hope that the new transatlantic body – EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) – will give the EU and the US a stronger footing to 
keep pace and enable the promotion of joint standards around emerging technologies. Beyond trade, standards and supply chains, 
areas for cooperation include promoting democratic values within the digital realm as well as greater innovation and investment 
across the EU and US. The alliance should be designed to work with othe r like-minded countries, including Australia and Japan, and at 
international bodies like the World Trade Organization. (Scott and Barigazzi, 2021).
