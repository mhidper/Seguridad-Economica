Abstract 
This article develops an enhanced bottom-up and data-driven methodology to detect EU 
strategic dependencies using highly disaggregated product-level trade data. It identifies 204 
products in sensitive industrial ecosystems where the EU experiences an important level of 
foreign dependencies. A subset of these products are then identified as particularly 
problematic given that their world trade networks can experience Single Point of Failures 
(SPOF). Since dependent products bear important risks in the event of unexpected 
disruptions, identifying them is the first step towards building resilience. Consequently, this 
analysis provides evidence based solutions to the EU’s open strategic autonomy agenda, 
including the efforts to diversify EU supply chains, to pursue partnerships with like-minded 
partners, and to strengthen the EU’s internal industrial capacity.

 1. Introduction 
Over the past decades, the EU has faced increasingly complex challenges in the 
social, environmental and economic spheres such as climate change, the ageing of 
its population, and a massive ongoing digitisation. While it is clear that some of these 
challenges can create several opportunities,4 they also exercised some pressures on 
Europe’s economy, industry and society. Moreover, these threats have been 
exacerbated over the recent past with the impact of an open-ended “permacrisis”5 or 
“age of disorder”,6 characterised by continuous disruptions and persistent high 
degrees of uncertainty (European Commission, 2022b). Indeed, the previous 
challenges are magnified through the reinforcing effects of global events such as the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian aggression of Ukraine, and the energy crisis. 
Consequently, a great share of contemporary disruptions risk having medium-term 
consequences in the form of increasing geopolitical tensions, including those linked 
to the scarce availability of energy sources and raw materials, as well as an 
underpinning and deep redefinition of the architecture and dynamics of global supply 
chains.  
Some interrelated factors can simultaneously affect the world map of strategic 
dependencies and the ongoing reshape of global value chains in the long run. First, 
over the last decades, there has been a continuous process of de-industrialization 
that led to a loss of manufacturing capacity in the EU and other high-income 
economies, particularly for industries based on cost competitiveness and with low 
productive investments (Vu et al., 2021). Second, the ongoing “shoring” practices, 
with firms increasingly taking different strategies when it comes to localisation 
decisions, are driven by updated parameters. Among others, these parameters 
include the intensity of supply chain distress, the availability of raw materials, the 
probability of being hit by a logistics crunch, the availability of skills, R&D 
investments, and the generosity of the business environment (Fernández-Miguel et 
al., 2022; Alguacil et al., 2023). Third, a progressive shift in dependencies occurs as 
a result of the current energy transition. In this regard, the EU is moving away from 
fossil fuels, for which Eastern Europe has traditionally been a key EU provider, into 
raw materials, where EU demand has conventionally been met by supply from 
foreign markets.7 In this respect, the International Energy Agency (IEA) (2021) 
forecasts an insufficient raw material supply to cover global demand in inputs such as 
cobalt, which is essential to develop batteries. Another example are permanent 
magnets, where China dominates global supply chains, from mining and refinement 
                                                           
4 For example, in order to suppo the opportunities from digitalisation the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 was adopted, 
with objectives and targets in the area of skills and infrastructure, the digitalisation of businesses, online public services and 
EU’s digital rights and principles. See https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec/2022/2481/oj .

 through to production (Gauß et al., 2021), which are critical for the production of e-
vehicles and wind turbines.  
Fourth, wide-ranging supply chain disruptions are inducing important changes in the 
structure of supply chains. Indeed, the EU benefits from an open and integrated 
participation in global value chains in terms of efficiency and resilience (Camarero et 
al., 2023), and this is particularly the case in years without disruptive events. 
However, recent developments revealed how supply distress, initially confined to the 
health ecosystem (e.g. personal protective equipment), later expanded onto most 
other ecosystems (e.g. electronics, mobility, renewable energy, construction, energy 
intensive industries) have affected global supply chains. Supply challenges, from 
energy products (e.g. gas), basic raw materials (e.g. magnesium) to high-tech 
products (e.g. semiconductors), risk delaying the EU’s economic recovery and 
slowing down our pursuit of the twin transitions (green and digital). Such supply 
distress gets amplified by supply chain concentration, increases in global demand 
driven by structural shifts, logistics crunches or trade policy restrictions (Benoît et al., 
2022; Amaral et al., 2022).8 Fifth, skills mismatches, including labour shortages, arise 
as a key factor that limits industrial production, together with insufficient demand and 
material constraints (Kiss et al., 2022). Given that this factor is particularly worrisome 
in some country-sectors, it can have an impact on global supply chains if some of 
these shortages are not corrected.  
It is against this backdrop that the EU is pursuing a new approach to industrial policy 
underpinned by the concept of “open strategic autonomy”, which rests on two goals. 
The first one is the relevance of the EU as a geographical area open to international 
trade based on stable rules. Indeed, access to international trade and international 
supply chains have proven most effective in promoting the productivity of European 
firms (Shu and Steinwender, 2019), their innovation (Akcigit and Melitz, 2021; 
European Commission, 2022b), and resilience (Baldwin and Freeman, 2021). The 
second objective is to create internal domestic capacity there where needed, and 
notably in strategic areas such as in health related products, batteries, hydrogen, 
electronic chips or raw materials. In this respect, similar strategies have also been 
adopted by the EU’s main trading partners.9  
Based on these two objectives, the EU published its updated industrial strategy in 
2021, European Commission (2021a), with a focus on curbing the EU’s strategic 
dependencies where the EU faces excessive reliance on foreign sources combined 
                                                           
8 Benoît et al. (2022) show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, concentrated global supply chains and structural global 
demand shifts were an important driver of import price pressures. More precisely, the most important price increases occurred 
for: (1) products that combine a strong reliance on foreign imports with a particularly high import concentration and (2) products 
experiencing a higher structural demand prior to the COVID-19 shock. In addition, Amaral et al. (2022) combined dynamic 
indicators on the evolution of import prices and quantities useful to alert policy makers on ongoing supply chain disruptions, with 
the concept of structural dependencies allowing to identify ex-ante risks of disruptions.

 with limited domestic production capacity, through a better understanding of both 
technological and industrial vulnerabilities.  
Recent developments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine and the energy price hike have reinforced the political 
objective of the EU to roll out its open strategic autonomy agenda to avoid risks 
associated with the “non-availability” of critical intermediate and final products. The 
European Chips Act,10 the Single Market Emergency Instrument (SMEI)11 and the 
European Critical Raw Materials Act, the latter announced by the European 
Commission President in her State of the Union speech of September 2022,12 are 
clear steps in that direction. Given the rapidly evolving political and policy backdrop, it 
appears more relevant than ever before to regularly revisit and enhance the 
methodology introduced by the European Commission (2021b) to monitor and 
anticipate strategic dependencies in sensitive industrial ecosystems.  
 
2. An overview of empirical analyses to detect strategic 
dependencies 
Previous empirical analyses that detected strategic dependencies rest on five main 
types of methodological approaches.  
The first type of empirical analyses focuses on the aggregate sectoral level and finds 
mostly EU dependencies in industrial ecosystems such as electronics or energy 
intensive industries. Relying on databases linking country-sector pairs in global 
supply chains, Dachs et al. (2022) investigate the strategic position of the EU27 in 
global value chains and production networks and find that the EU industrial 
ecosystems that show high dependencies on Chinese electronics include energy 
intensive industries, aerospace and defence. They also detect dependencies on 
energy intensive industries vis-à-vis Russia, and energy intensive industries and 
retail from the US.   
The second category of analyses uses product level data capturing global trade flows 
and it offers the advantage of using higher data granularity in order to detect specific 
world-level vulnerabilities. In other words, these work strands aim at measuring risks 
in global supply chains by detecting potential global “single points of failures” 
(SPOFs), which are nodes in the global trade system that, due to their centrality and 
weight, can have a major impact on supply chains and even put a halt on their 
                                                           
10 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework of measures for 
strengthening Europe's semiconductor ecosystem (Chips Act), COM/2022/46 final: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52022PC0046    
11 The Commission proposed to create a new Single Market Emergency Instrument (SMEI) which is a crisis governance 
framework that aims to preserve the free movement of goods, services and persons and the availability of essential goods and 
services in the event of future emergencies, to the benefit of citizens and businesses across the EU. (See 
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_5443 for more details).

 operations. For example, Korniyenko et al. (2017) developed a methodology, based 
on indicators on global players that allowed them to determine products 
characterised by “choke points” in global trade networks. The authors conclude that 
most of these products fall under broad categories, such as machinery and 
mechanical appliances, transport equipment, pharmaceutical products, rubber 
articles and precision instruments. Reiter and Stehrer (2021) extended this analysis 
in order to compute a “product riskiness indicator” at global level. This was done by 
adding the Hirschmann-Herfindahl index (HHI) on world exports and an additional 
indicator identifying products targeted by non-tariff measures.  
Third, while these studies aim at detecting vulnerable products or trade nodes at the 
world level, the trade portfolio of each country appears rather heterogeneous. This 
supports the need for targeted studies that concentrate on particular world regions. 
Three examples of such work follow. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Bonneau and Nakaa (2020) examined French extra-EU dependencies by looking at 
the import concentration level and centrality in product-level trade networks. Using 
six-digit level Harmonized System (HS6) data, they reduced the number of product 
categories from around 5,000 to 12 products where vulnerabilities were particularly 
present in France. Furthermore, European Commission (2021b), as part of its 
updated industrial strategy in 2021, presented a methodology to identify EU’s 
strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities. They depart from highly disaggregated 
trade data and encompass 5,200 HS6 products. Building indicators and 
corresponding criteria that look at import concentration, relevance of extra EU 
imports, and the possibility to replace with internal capacity, the European 
Commission identified 137 products in sensitive industrial ecosystems for which the 
EU shows foreign dependencies. In addition, they reduced the list to 34 vulnerable 
products with low capacity for further diversification and substitution. Finally, in a 
similar spirit, Guinea and Sharma (2022) classified EU traded products into four 
groups according to the degree of import dependency, relying on the more granular 
8-digit Combined Nomenclature classification of products (CN8).13  
Fourth, while the previous types of empirical analyses use trade in goods, 
confidential firm level data can be used to expand the level of granularity. In this 
regard, Jaravel and Méjean (2021) added the firm level dimension by looking at the 
import concentration on a few foreign firms. Out of around 9000 CN8 product 
categories analysed, they concluded that 122 products were particularly vulnerable to 
production concentration in a few country-firm pairs. The most predominant origins of 
dependencies were found to be the US and China.  
Finally, additional studies use targeted information to explore specific products, 
areas, technologies or services.  For example, European Commission (2020) 
identified 30 raw materials as critical by evaluating over 80 individual raw materials 
                                                           
13 Note that trade flows at CN8 level can only be done using the EU as a reference point. 
10 
 with two criteria, namely, the economic importance and the supply risk. In addition, 
given the complexity of analysing dependencies in service technologies in a 
systematic manner, the European Commission (2021b, 2022a) assessed 
vulnerabilities using qualitative and quantitative information in areas of strategic 
importance such as cloud and edge computing, solar panel technologies, 
cybersecurity and IT software, clean hydrogen among others.  
 
3. A refined methodology to detect and monitor strategic 
dependencies  
Using the latest data developments, this article builds on the identification strategy 
proposed by the European Commission (2021b) and improves it by introducing a 
number of changes that permit to enrich the data-driven approach to identify the EU’s 
foreign dependencies.   
 
3.1 The European Commission’s benchmark methodology  
The methodology proposed by the European Commission (2021b) used the BACI 
database,14 which covers global bilateral trade flows for 200 countries at the product 
level.15 BACI is an optimal source of trade information at it reconciles global trade 
flows and it allows to compare values of imports and exports of each country. Three 
core dependency indicators (CDIs) were used to identify products with low level of 
import diversification, for which foreign sources were particularly relevant for the EU, 
and where the substitutability potential with EU supply was limited.  
The first indicator (CDI 1) captures products with a low level of import diversification. 
CDI1 thus targets products for which EU imports (in values) are highly concentrated 
in a few extra EU countries using the well-known Herfindahl-Hirschman Index 
(HHI):16  
𝐶𝐷𝐼ଵ=෍(𝑠௜ଶ)௡
௜ୀଵ 
The second indicator (CDI 2) identifies how important foreign sources are for the EU 
being a proxy for EU scarcity. By measuring the importance of extra-EU imports in 
total EU imports (i.e. extra- and intra-EU imports), CDI 2 helps to detect products 
where foreign sources are particularly important for the EU: 
                                                           
14  See Gaulier, G. and Zignago, S. (2010) for more details.   
15 The BACI database relies on raw data from the UN statistical Division (COMTRADE dataset). 
16 𝑠௜ represents the market share of the extra EU supplying country i in EU’s imports, and n is the total number of extra EU 
supplying countries.   
11 
 𝐶𝐷𝐼ଶ=𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎 𝐸𝑈 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑈 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 
The third indicator (CDI 3) explores to what degree extra-EU imports can be 
substituted by EU production. Using EU total exports as a proxy for the internal 
production capacity, CDI 3 captures whether EU production can cover the extra EU 
import needs in the event of trade disruptions. 
𝐶𝐷𝐼ଷ=𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎 𝐸𝑈 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒ா௎
𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒ா௎ 
Then, the identification of specific foreign dependencies was based on the 
application of pre-defined thresholds on the three indicators described.  Each of the 
5200 HS6 traded goods was evaluated based on the described indicators, and 
products that satisfied pre-defined specific thresholds were selected. For CDI 1, the 
chosen threshold was 0.4, indicating that the EU import value originates mainly from 
2.5 foreign countries. For CDI 2, the threshold of 0.5 was selected, indicating that the 
value of extra EU imports accounts for more than 50% of the total EU import value. 
Finally, for CDI 3, the threshold was 1, indicating that the value of extra EU imports is 
higher than the value of total EU exports, which includes intra and extra EU exports. 
Applying the three indicators and their respective thresholds to the sample of trade 
flows in 2018, allowed to identify around 390 products across all ecosystems where 
the EU faced foreign dependencies. Out of these, 137 products were located in 
sensitive ecosystems, identified as those related to: (1) security and safety, (2) health 
and (3) the green and digital transformation.  
These 137 products represented around 6% of the EU’s total import value of goods 
from extra-EU sources in 2018, with China accounting for more than 52% of the total 
import value of dependent products, followed by Vietnam and Brazil. Moreover, the 
majority of the identified dependencies were intermediate goods. In terms of sectors, 
the majority of these foreign dependencies belong to raw/processed materials and 
chemicals, some of which are extremely important for the green transition, such as 
lithium, cobalt, nickel or manganese among others. Then, the methodology reduced 
further the list to 34 HS6 products by using the world concentration of exports and 
the absolute difference of EU import and EU export prices. These 34 products are 
characterised by a limited global potential for diversification and substitution.  
  
12 
  3.2 The enhanced methodology in three steps  
The analysis to identify EU foreign dependencies conducted by European 
Commission (2021b) in the context of the industrial strategy update was a first of its 
kind. However, there is now a need to enhance it in order to incorporate the latest 
data and developments in the methodology.  
The first step in the enhanced methodology is the use of a more suitable dataset to 
control for product re-exports.  Trade statistics record flows from an origin to a 
destination country for a specific HS6 product code, in values and volumes. There 
are however well-known “trade asymmetries” or mismatches between exports for a 
given origin-destination (country A to B) and imports of the mirror flow (country B 
from A). As previously mentioned, for this reason, the European Commission (2021b) 
used the BACI-CEPII database to identify EU foreign dependencies instead of relying 
on raw trade data such as COMTRADE. However, BACI also experiences some well-
known limitations. In particular, there is a bias when identifying strategic 
dependencies if products get re-exported through different intermediate countries, 
before being imported to the final destination. This can affect the outcome of the 
dependencies analysis, as it can artificially reduce (or increase) dependency levels of 
some products. To circumvent this problem, we rely on the TRADE-FIGARO-
EUROSTAT database that uses a methodology to identify trade flows categorised as 
re-exports (Ferreira, 2018; Remond-Tiedrez and Rueda-Cantuche, 2019).17 The 
advantage of this database compared to BACI is that it permits to distinguish 
between products imported from a given location where the product is domestically 
produced and those destinations where the product goes in the form of transit.18 
However, despite its clear advantage, it has also a limitation compared to more 
regional trade databases (e.g. COMEXT), which contain more granular information 
on the traded products but do not include trade flows between third countries.19  
The second step  concerns the adoption of a dynamic perspective. In order to detect 
EU dependencies, the previous analysis relied on trade data from 2018. However, 
relying on a specific year risks hiding structural vulnerabilities that can be made more 
apparent over time. For this reason, this upgrade on the methodology will rely on a 
longer time window, namely 4 years.  
                                                           
17 The FIGARO database is jointly compiled by Eurostat in collaboration with the European Commission’s Joint Research 
Centre and provides a consistent overview of national accounts with data on business, trade and jobs for EU Member States, 18 
main EU trading partners and a rest of the world region. In this paper, we used the underlying (unpublished) version of a 
balanced view of trade in  goods statistics, as described in Remond-Tiedrez and Rueda-Cantuche (2019, chapter 6), with 
thousands of products, for HS codes at 6 digit level and a correct treatment of re-exports combining UN Comtrade and EU 
Comext information. 
18 The treatment of re-exports is extensively performed for the EU and, to the extent possible, for other third countries. Given 
that there are some asymmetries in the treatment of re-exports across countries, the TRADE-FIGARO-EUROSTAT dataset is 
very well suited to study EU foreign dependencies and less suited to draw comparisons between the dependencies of the EU 
and those of third countries. To that end the BACI dataset, which ensures an even treatment of all countries, is more 
appropriate, even though it suffers from the drawback of not considering re-exports.  
19 While a high disaggregation (e.g. CN8 or TARIC 10 digits) would provide a much finer level of granularity, our analysis has to 
rely on HS6 product categories (HS 2017), for which total global trade flows are available.   
13 
 The choice for a multi-year time frame is justified by the idea that while dependencies 
are normally structural in nature, they can vary as a result of multiple factors, which 
includes trade instruments, domestic subsidies or supply chain disruptions. For 
example, in a specific year, a trade measure on a product-origin pair could artificially 
affect the observed number of dependencies.  
The analysis is thus performed individually on each of the four years considered and, 
to give higher informative value to the most updated information, a product is 
considered as foreign dependent if it is identified in the list of dependencies in: (1) 
2020 (the most recent data point), and/or (2) two out the three years prior to 2020 
(e.g. 2019 and 2017, 2018 and 2017).  
The third step  relates to the complementary use of two methods to identify foreign 
dependencies. The benchmark methodology used specific thresholds to identify 
dependent products. Their economic rationale is explained in European Commission 
(2021b) and in the previous sub-section. It has the main benefit of simplicity but it is 
affected by the arbitrary choice of thresholds. For this reason, we complement the 
threshold approach with an analysis using the whole distribution of the dependency 
indicators. Notably, the article uses the three indicators described in the benchmark 
methodology ( 𝐶𝐷𝐼ଵ,𝐶𝐷𝐼ଶ,and 𝐶𝐷𝐼ଷ) in order to identify products that are “highly 
concentrated”, “significantly imported” and “low substitutable”. As in the benchmark 
methodology, we apply the pre-defined specific thresholds defined in the previous 
sub-section to each of the indicators. We then use a complementary approach, which 
relies on the top 10% products in the aggregate level of dependency, drawing on the 
ranks of all three described indicators.  
More precisely, each of the three indicators is ranked based on their dependency 
risk, with the highest risk identified with the highest rank.20 To obtain an overall 
dependency indicator, we aggregate the individual ranks of each indicator by using a 
simple average. Then, the most dependent products are those situated in the top 
10% products in terms of aggregated rank, indicating a higher risk of dependency. 
EU dependencies are then identified for products that satisfy both approaches, 
namely, the “threshold” and the “rank”. 
Each of these three developments will affect the benchmark analysis carried out by 
the European Commission (2021b) in a different manner. The first enhancement 
related to the treatment of re-exports can either increase or decrease the number of 
dependencies on foreign sources. When it comes to the concentration of extra-EU 
imports, the bias induced by not treating re-exports can be two-fold. First, if a product 
is imported by the EU through different intermediate countries, despite the ultimate 
origin being the same, the concentration observed on EU imports can be artificially 
                                                           
20 For the concentration indicator, products with the highest concentration levels are given a high rank. In second indicator, 
products where non-EU imports account for the highest share are identified as having the highest risk. Finally, for the third 
indicator, products where the EU exports account for a lower share of extra-EU imports are considered as experiencing higher 
risks and get assigned higher ranks.

 underestimated. Second, if a product is imported by the EU from a single 
intermediate country, despite multiple sources being at the origin of the product in 
question, the concentration observed on EU imports can be artificially overestimated. 
Furthermore, treating re-exports is also important when computing the indicators 
referring to EU scarcity and production capacity. More precisely, if re-exports are not 
taken into account total EU imports and exports are overestimated. This would lead 
to an underestimation of the EU scarcity and an overestimation of the EU production 
capacity (proxied through total EU exports). To sum up, not treating re-exports would 
create a bias in the identification of EU foreign dependencies.21  
The second step is also expected to increase the number of identified dependencies 
as we are expanding the time frame by taking into account the 2017-2020 period. 
The expansion of the time window under analysis leads to the identification of a 
higher number of dependencies, which will be then restricted by taking into account 
the more structural dependencies besides the most updated information. Finally, the 
third and last step  is expected to decrease the number of identified dependencies as 
we are adding a new condition for the classification of foreign dependencies, which is 
based on the distribution of the overall level of dependency on top of economic 
thresholds. 
 
4.  Results 
As a result of the three previous upgrades, out of approximately 5,400 HS6 
products,22 564 are identified as those satisfying the above mentioned criteria.23 They 
represent around 13% of total extra-EU imports, approximately 19% belong to 
“Chemicals and allied industries”, almost 17% to “Textiles”, 9% to “Animal products”, 
almost 8% to “Vegetable products” and 7% to “Mechanical appliances and electrical 
equipment”. As regards to the origin of these dependencies, China is the first source 
providing 211 products, which represent more than half of the import value of all 
dependent goods. The US is the second source with 62 products and 8% in terms of 
import values. Other important countries in terms of import value include Vietnam 
(6%), UK (3%), Norway (3%) and Russia (2%).  
Next, as in the original methodology, we focus on products within critical ecosystems.  
In particular, we concentrate on HS6 products relevant for areas such as security and 
                                                           
21 When replicating the European Commission (2021b) exercise based on the TRADE-FIGARO-EUROSTAT database, which 
takes into account re-exports, the number of EU foreign dependent products increases by approximately 27% compared with 
the benchmark exercise based on the BACI dataset, which identified 388 EU dependent products in all ecosystems. This 
suggests that, in the case of the EU, not considering re-exports leads to an underestimation of EU dependencies.  
22 The enhanced methodology exploits 5,400 HS6 products in the HS2017 classification. The benchmark methodology in 
European Commission (2021b) used the 5,200 HS6 products in the HS2012 classification. 
23 Slightly less than 50% of the 564 foreign dependencies are very persistent/structural, as they are identified in all years over 
the 2017-2020 period. 
15 
 safety, health, and the green and digital transitions. As a result, 360 out of the 564 
HS6 product categories were disregarded.24 25 26 27  
Following the previous steps, we obtain 204 HS6 product categories characterised as 
foreign dependent in strategic ecosystems.28 Within the energy intensive industries, 
the list of dependent products cover raw materials, which are used as inputs across 
other industrial ecosystems. This includes manganese, nickel, aluminium, chromium, 
rare earth metals, molybdenum, borates, uranium, silicon, permanent magnets.29 In 
addition, we also find dependencies in traditional energy inputs such as coal or 
petroleum coke and gases. Within the health ecosystem, we find products such as 
heterocyclic compounds, some medicines, vitamins, alkaloids, iodine, amino-acids, 
medical instruments (e.g. scintigraphic apparatus, mechano-therapy or orthopaedic 
appliances), as well as COVID-19 related goods such as surgical gloves or protective 
garments.30  
Among goods within the renewable ecosystem, foreign dependencies include raw 
materials that are heavily used in this context and final products such as photovoltaic 
cells or LED lamps.31 Within the digital ecosystem, we observe products such as 
laptops, mobile phones, monitors or projectors.32 Among the products with defence 
applications, we identify products such as navigational instruments for aeronautical 
and space navigation, rough movement watches, inflatable rafts, radio broadcast 
receivers or electric generators. This ecosystem also includes more rudimentary 
inputs such as camping equipment, which can be particularly useful in catastrophic 
events or in terms of foreign aid.  
Finally, while the agri-food ecosystem was left out of the analysis, some agri-related 
products can have a direct impact on the safety of European citizens. For this 
reason, we decided to keep those products used as important inputs in the 
                                                           
24 While the agri-food ecosystem is strategic in nature, we consider individual products as non-strategic due to their 
substitutability potential. Within this ecosystem, products disregarded include different types of fishes, different parts of sheep, 
crustaceans, molluscs, nuts, fruits, spices, exotic vegetables such as manioc and sweet potatoes or whiskies. 
25 Among the HS6 product categories within textiles, we disregarded the following products: tanned and crust skins/hides, 
artificial fur, silk and silk products, different types of cotton yarn, fabrics made of woven, yarn, carpets, type of footwear, toilet 
and kitchen linen or small cases made of different materials among others.  
26 Among HS6 product categories related to construction, we disregarded types of (tropical) wood, various products made of 
bamboo, ceramic statuettes or products within the ceramic ecosystem such as feldspar or leucite. 
27 Other products include Christmas lights, umbrellas, sets of cutlery, hair dryers, music boxes, cooking appliances, weighing 
machines, photographic cameras, different types of design wrist-watches (non-defense related), sport’s equipment (e.g. skates, 
tennis balls, athletics and gymnastics equipment, water sport equipment among others).   
28 While each of these products has applications in strategic ecosystems, assessing their level of strategic importance is beyond 
the scope of this data-driven exercise.  
29 Comprehensive exercises allow to have a comparison of dependent products across the whole economy. However, some 
targeted exercises can be potentially better equipped to capture the specificities of some sectors. In the case of raw materials, 
the European Commission conducted a more targeted exercise to identify a list of critical raw materials by looking at their 
economic importance and supply risk ( https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/areas-specific-
interest/critical-raw-materials_en ). Despite the methodological differences driven by different objectives, our comprehensive 
exercise also identifies more than half of the products included in the list of critical raw materials.  
30 The most updated trade data goes back to 2020. As a result of the EU industrial actions resulting from COVID-19 pandemic, 
some of the identified dependencies in COVID-19 related goods could have been reduced.  
31 Soya beans are also included in this category of products given their role in the production of biodiesel. See Soybeans for 
Biodiesel Production – Farm Energy (extension.org) for more details.  
32 Video games are kept in the list of products due to the vast “productive” applications  of the attached human capital (transferable 
skills), as some of these applications might be being critical inputs across different ecosystems. 
16 
 production of food. In this group, we identify a number of fertilizers, as well as critical 
inputs in farming and fishing with examples such as soya beans or fishing rods. 
The 204 products get then distributed according to their geographical origin of 
dependency and the specific sector (i.e. HS section) they belong to taking into 
account that these products represent around 9.2% of total extra-EU imports. 
Approximately 43% belong to “Chemicals and allied industries”, around 14% to 
“Mechanical Appliances and electrical equipment”, almost 12% to “Base metals and 
its articles”, 11% to “Mineral products” and 6% to “Precision and medical instruments” 
(see Figure 1).

In terms of the origin of these dependencies, China is the first source for 
approximately 31% of all 204 products (i.e. 64 goods), accounting for more than half 
of the value of these products.33 The US represents the main source for almost 19% 
of the 204 dependent products in sensitive ecosystems (i.e. 38 products) and 
amounts to 9% of the import value. Russia accounts for 7% of the 204 products (i.e. 
15 goods) and 3% in terms of import value (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).34  
 
 
  
                                                           
33 For simplicity of illustration, Figure 2 distributes products based on the main source of EU imports. However, second origins 
can be particularly important in some cases. Note that all origins are entirely accounted for in Figure 3, which considers the 
value of imports.  
34 In the analysis of the European Commission (2021b), China represented around 52% of the total value of imports of the most 
foreign dependent products, which is broadly consistent with our new results. However, the other two main sources are 
different. While the current study points to the US and Russia as main sources of dependencies after China, the previous study 
highlighted Vietnam and Brazil.   0 10 20 30 40 50Products of the chemical or allied…Mechanical appliances; electrical…Base metals & articles of base metalMineral productsPrecision & medical instrumentsTextilesPlastics & rubber articlesTransport equipmentPrecious or semi-precious stonesMiscellaneous manufactured articlesVegetable products

 5. Introducing the concept of global single points of 
failures (SPOFs) 
The list of EU dependencies in strategic ecosystems can be complemented with the 
characteristics of the global network for each of the 204 identified products. This will 
allow to detect those goods whose production is highly concentrated at a world level, 
and which can be considered as highly vulnerable in case of supply chain 
disruptions. To address this concern, previous economic literature has pointed to the 
need to identify global SPOFs when analysing the risk of global disruptions. The 
trade data used in this analysis contains a level of disaggregation (i.e. HS6 product 
categories) which makes it possible to analyse global trade flows, including 
exchanges between non-EU countries. Hence, it is possible to assess the risk of 
SPOFs by targeting products with two features: (1) a central node in world trade 
networks, and (2) high concentration of world exports. To do so, two indicators have 
to be defined.  
First, to assess the ex-ante risk of experiencing a SPOF for a particular product, we 
use an indicator, which is widely exploited in network analysis, in order to capture the 
risk of centrality.35 It allows to identify situations where an exporter is central to a 
large number of countries in a trade network on the assumption that it might be 
problematic to global trade if there is a trade disruption that affects a central node in 
the trade network. The higher the value of this indicator, the higher the risk of 
centrality. 
Second, a certain number of identified dependencies can be considered as more 
vulnerable given their risk of experiencing excessive production concentration in a 
given country. To evaluate this risk, we define a measure for concentration of world 
exports using the HHI index and relying on the total export flows of each country for a 
given product. A high level of concentration of world exports for a given product can 
indicate that its production is more likely to be concentrated in a single country, 
generating negative spillover effects across the globe in case of a supply shock. 
                                                           
35 Based on Korniyenko et al. (2017) and Reiter and Stehrer (2021), the indicator computes the standard deviation of the 
weighted outdegree centrality of each product and measures the risk of centrality in a network or, in other words, the presence 
of weighty central players, which might create risk in case of a trade disruption. A measure of outdegree centrality is obtained 
first as the sum of ties that a country directs outwards, to other countries, as a share of the total number of other countries. This 
measure is weighted to take into account the value of the trade flows. In formal terms, the weighted centrality of each country 
and for each product network is as follows: 
𝐶௜௞௢௨௧=෍𝑤௜௝௞
𝑤ఫ௞തതതത ௡ିଵ
௝ୀଵ 
 where 𝐶௜௞௢௨௧ is the weighted outdegree centrality of country i in product k, n is the total number of countries in the trade network, 
𝑤௜௝ is the value of the exports of country i to country j in product k, and 𝑤ఫ௞തതതത is the average value of  j’s imports for each product k. 
Next, we use the standard deviation of outdegree centrality to measure the risk of each product, which arises from having very 
few central exporters.  
𝐶௞௢௨௧=ඨ∑൫𝐶௜௞௢௨௧−𝐶௞௢௨௧തതതതതത൯ଶ௡ିଵ
௜ୀଵ
𝑛−1 
 where 𝐶௞௢௨௧തതതതതത is the average centrality of countries for product k. 
19 
 The calculated risk of global SPOF is obtained by combining these two indicators. 
First, we obtain the rank for each individual product and each of the two indicators. 
Second, we combine these ranks into a single average rank, which determines the 
level of risk of SPOF. Finally, we group products into deciles (i.e. 10 groups) based 
on the aggregate risk of SPOF.36  
Products with the highest aggregate risk of SPOF are situated in the upper decile 
(i.e. decile 10) of all HS6 products, while products with the lowest risk of SPOF are in 
the lowest deciles. Figure 4 shows that out of the 204 dependent products around 
19% are in the category of the highest risk of global SPOF, whereas only 6% are in 
the category of the lowest risk. Within the highest risk, we find products across 
different industrial ecosystems, including health (antibiotics, vitamins, medical 
apparatus and COVID-19 goods), digital (laptops and parts, radio-broadcast 
receivers or mobile phones), or renewables (LED lights or part of cycles). Risks of 
SPOF are also detected in humanitarian emergency-related goods such as tents or 
travelling blankets.

 6. Conclusion  
Against the backdrop of the effects stemming from the “permacrisis” dynamics, 
triggered by events such as the COVID pandemics, the Russian aggression of 
Ukraine, and the energy crisis, this article provides an enhanced methodology in 
support of an improved understanding and monitoring of EU strategic dependencies, 
drawing on European Commission (2021b).   
Enhancing this monitoring capacity is particularly timely given the ongoing process of 
redefinition of the architecture and dynamics of global supply chains influenced by 
the ongoing de-industrialization in the EU and other high-income economies, the 
emergence of updated shoring practices, a progressive shift in dependencies from 
fossil fuels into raw materials, disruptions in global supply chains, as well as skills 
mismatches and labour shortages.  
The article proposes an enhanced methodology that uses the latest disaggregated 
data at product level to identify 204 products in sensitive industrial ecosystems where 
the EU faces foreign dependencies. We detect that around 70% of the products 
identified by European Commission (2021b) are present in the results from this 
enhanced methodology, suggesting that factors such as the EU economic and 
industrial structure, as well as historical trade relations underlie these dependencies.  
Two findings derive from this exercise. First, mapping vulnerabilities across EU 
supply chains, including the risks of non-availability of critical goods, can prove 
valuable to develop early warning systems to monitor supply chain distress. The 
enhanced methodology permits to differentiate between products with potential for 
diversification (i.e. low risk of single points of failure or SPOFs) and those where 
further trade diversification might be limited (i.e. high risk of SPOF). It thus helps to 
detect ex-ante vulnerabilities stemming from structural dependencies associated with 
higher risks of supply distress.  
Finally, the methodology allows to identify products for which substitutability can only 
happen through the increase of the EU’s internal capacity. As previously shown, 
some of the detected and persistent EU dependencies experience high risk of 
SPOFs at a global scale. Consequently, disruptions in these products are particularly 
prone to bear an impact on the EU’s resilience, resulting in non-availability in the 
event of idiosyncratic shocks. The development of internal EU capacity around those 
products (e.g. within the electronics ecosystem), including through strong 
investments and R&D deployment, can contribute to increase substitutability. Policy 
initiatives such as the European Chips Act, the Single Market Emergency Instrument 
(SMEI) or the European Critical Raw Materials Act are all steps in that direction.
