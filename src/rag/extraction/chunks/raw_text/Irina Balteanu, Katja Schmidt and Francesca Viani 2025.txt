Abstract
Highly concentrated imports can be a source of vulnerability in an environment 
characterized by geopolitical tensions. In light of this concern, some recently adopted 
policies aim to dilute advanced economies’ import concentration for key products. 
Likewise, a tendency towards supplier diversification has been observed in firm surveys. 
In this paper, we study how countries’ import concentration in a few external providers 
affects import prices. Import concentration decreased in OECD countries in the last two 
decades, especially up to the global financial crisis, in the hyper-globalization period. 
For EU countries, integration in the single market was crucial to foster diversification 
also beyond the hyper-globalization years. Yet, for a number of strategic goods, imports 
tend to be more concentrated in geopolitically distant providers. Panel regression 
analysis based on granular trade data at the country-product level shows that high 
import concentration is associated with higher import prices, which supports the view 
that strongly concentrated markets correspond to low levels of competition. This effect 
tends to be more pronounced when a supplier country’s perceived market power is 
strong, i.e. for goods whose production is highly concentrated at the global level or for 
those that a country cannot (fully) produce by itself. The positive relationship between 
import concentration and import prices is less pronounced in high-technology industries, 
consistent with the notion that in these sectors a high concentration is also related to the 
presence of cost-efficiency effects owing to economies of scale. Exclusive trade relations, 
i.e. those in which the importer sources a product from one provider only, are associated 
with lower import prices and could therefore be costlier to break.

Resumen
Las importaciones altamente concentradas pueden constituir una fuente de vulnerabilidad 
para el importador, especialmente en un entorno caracterizado por tensiones 
geopolíticas. A la luz de esta consideración, algunas políticas recientemente adoptadas 
por economías clave tienen como objetivo disminuir la concentración de importaciones 
de productos considerados estratégicos. También se ha observado una tendencia similar 
hacia la diversificación de los proveedores en las encuestas empresariales. En este 
estudio, investigamos cómo la concentración de las importaciones de un país en unos 
pocos proveedores externos afecta al precio que este paga por sus importaciones. La 
concentración de las importaciones disminuyó en los países de la Organización para 
la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico en las últimas dos décadas, especialmente 
hasta la crisis financiera global, durante el período de hiperglobalización. Para los países 
de la Unión Europea, la integración en el mercado único fue crucial para fomentar la 
diversificación también más allá de los años de hiperglobalización. Sin embargo, en lo 
que respecta a una serie de bienes estratégicos, las importaciones tienden a estar más 
concentradas en proveedores geopolíticamente distantes. Las regresiones de panel 
basadas en datos comerciales granulares a nivel de país-producto muestran que una 
elevada concentración de las importaciones está asociada con precios de importación 
más altos, lo cual es compatible con la noción de que los mercados fuertemente 
concentrados corresponden a un bajo nivel de competencia. Este efecto tiende a ser más 
pronunciado en los casos en los que el poder de mercado percibido del proveedor es 
fuerte, para bienes cuya producción está altamente concentrada a nivel mundial, o para 
aquellos que un país no puede (totalmente) producir por sí mismo. La relación positiva 
entre la concentración de las importaciones y su precio es menos pronunciada en las 
industrias de alta tecnología, en consonancia con la idea de que en estos sectores una 
alta concentración también está relacionada con la presencia de economías de escala. 
Las relaciones comerciales exclusivas, es decir, aquellas en las que el importador obtiene 
un producto de un solo proveedor, están asociadas con precios de importación más 
bajos y, por lo tanto, podrían ser más costosas de romper.

BANCO DE ESPAÑA7 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2503 1 Introduction
In the last years, several events have brought forward the potential risks implied by external trade
dependencies and, in particular, by a high concentration of imports in a few external providers.
Pandemic-related interruptions of trade flows, as well as trade tensions linked to US-China dis-
putes and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have shown that highly concentrated imports can
be a source of vulnerability for the importer in the face of external shocks –and the more so in
an environment characterized by geopolitical tensions and a potential weaponization of supply
chains. In light of these considerations, various policies recently adopted by the European Union
–like the Critical Raw Materials Act, the Chips Act, and the REPowerEU Plan— specifically
aim at decreasing import concentration for key products.12A tendency towards supplier
diversification has also been observed in recent firm surveys. An ECB survey of leading com-
panies operating in the euro area (Attinasi, Ioannou, Lebastard, and Morris, 2023) documents
that more than 60% of these firms are planning to diversify their input sourcing across different
countries in the next five years. Similarly, a coordinated business survey across Italy, Germany
and Spain shows that around half of firms sourcing critical inputs from China are implementing,
or plan to implement, de-risking strategies that involve input sourcing diversification (Balteanu,
Bottone, Ioannou, Kutten, Fernandez-Cerezo, Mancini, and Morris, 2024).
In light of these tendencies, a key question is how import diversification affects import –and
hence consumer— prices. This issue could be particularly relevant at the current juncture.
Several recent analyses show that geopolitical tensions might already be spurring a selective
process of international trade fragmentation along geopolitical lines ( Gopinath, 2023; Interna-
tional Monetary Fund, 2024; Fernandez-Villaverde, Mineyama, and Song, 2024). In the next
years, a potential deepening of geopolitical tensions and trade fragmentation tendencies could
give rise to negative supply shocks, trade disruptions and higher transport costs, with inflation-
ary consequences at the world level, as shown in IRC(2024). In this context, changes in import
concentration could have an additional and potentially significant impact on the level of import
prices, which could either limit or boost inflationary pressures.
Borrowing from industrial economic theory, a decrease in import concentration could impact
prices in two different ways, depending on the factors underlying import concentration itself. On
the one hand, if concentrated imports are optimal from an economic point of view –because they
are due, for instance, to the presence of economies of scale– a decrease in concentration could
limit cost-efficiency –for example, efficient scale effects–, thus resulting in higher import prices
(Covarrubias, Gutiérrez, and Philippon, 2020; Haskel and Westlake, 2017; Bonfiglioli, Crinò,
and Gancia, 2021). On the other hand, if concentrated imports are the result of some kind
of distortions that give rise to a low level of competition, then a push towards diversification
could be beneficial (Tirole, 1988). Namely, a tendency towards import diversification could make

Several recent analyses show that geopolitical tensions might already be spurring a selective

which would foster competition and result in lower import prices (Jaimovich, 2012). Therefore,
in theory, a lower import concentration could result either in higher or lower prices. Which effect
will materialize in practice is likely to be the outcome of complex effects, and could depend on
factors such as the type of products; their technological category and level of sophistication; their
position in the supply chain; the political proximity of suppliers; or on whether, for geographical
or industrial development circumstances, their production is restricted to a few global producers.
The aim of this paper is to study how countries’ import concentration affects the price they
pay for their imports. As a first step, we analyze the evolution of import concentration in a
sample of OECD and EU countries in the last two decades. We then investigate the impact of
the import concentration of these economies on their import prices using granular trade data. In
both analyses, we explore the role of sectoral heterogeneity, goods’ position in the supply chain,
the availability of diversification opportunities, and the political proximity of suppliers, with a
special focus on strategic goods, such as the ones related to the digital and green transition.
From a methodological point of view, we rely on bilateral trade flows data and bilateral trade
unit values data at the importer country level from, respectively, the CEPII-BACI database
(Gaulier and Zignago, 2010) and the CEPII-TUV database (Berthou and Emlinger, 2011). At
the product level, both sets of data are highly granular, getting up to the HS 6-digit level
and partitioning the universe of each country’s imports into more than 5100 different product
categories. The focus is on a sample of 43 importers encompassing OECD countries and other
EU economies that are not OECD members, between 1996 and 2022. We analyze the evolution
of the import concentration of these economies, as well as other dimensions of external trade
dependency, using a number of trade dependency indicators. Panel regressions at the importer-
product level are employed to study the impact of import concentration on import prices.
Results show that import concentration varies widely across importers. EU economies’ im-
ports are less concentrated with respect to other advanced countries’, with EU four largest
economies displaying the lowest levels of concentration. Import concentration decreased, on
average, in OECD countries in the last two decades, especially in the years up to the Global
Financial Crisis, in the so-called “hyper-globalization” period.3While in the hyper-globalization
years the decrease in import concentration was generalized across countries, dynamics were
more heterogeneous in the following "slow-balization" phase, as concentration kept decreasing
on average for EU economies while it stagnated in other countries. Key to foster the continued
import diversification of European economies, was their increasing integration in the intra-EU
market, with imports switching away from large traditional suppliers like Germany, Italy and
France and towards newly integrated providers such as Poland and Bulgaria. Another relevant
finding concerns the role of China as a leading global supplier. China is the main provider of the
majority of goods whose production, at the world level, is highly concentrated. Also, focusing

3on strategic products –advanced technology goods, technologies related to the green transition
and semiconductors— shows that OECD countries’ imports tend to be much more concentrated
in China with respect to other categories of products.
As concerns the impact of concentration on prices, panel analysis shows that countries whose
imports are highly concentrated in a few providers tend to pay a higher price for their imports
with respect to economies whose imports of the same products are more diversified across dif-
ferent suppliers. This finding is compatible with the view that strongly concentrated import
markets correspond to a low level of competition. A high import concentration results in even
higher prices in those cases in which firms’ perceived market power is strong –namely, for goods
whose production is highly concentrated at the world level, or that a country cannot (fully)
produce by itself. On the other hand, a higher geopolitical distance between an importer and
its main providers does not result in a higher impact of import concentration on prices. If on
average results point to a positive link between import concentration and import prices, findings
are more heterogeneous at the sectoral level. The positive relationship between concentration
and prices is much less pronounced in medium and high-technology industries with respect to
goods produced in sectors with a lower level of technological complexity, such as primary prod-
ucts, resource-based manufactures and low-tech. manufactures. This finding is consistent with
the notion that in higher-tech. industries a pronounced concentration is also associated to the
presence of pro-competitive effects and economies of scale –deriving most likely precisely from
their technological processes that rely heavily on IT and intangible capital, which have been
shown to give rise to relevant scale effects (Crouzet and Eberly, 2019; Bessen, 2020). The asso-
ciation between concentration and prices is also less pronounced for capital goods as compared
to final consumption goods and intermediate products, being capital goods mostly the prod-
uct of medium and high-tech. industries. Another special case are exclusive trade relations,
i.e. those instances in which the importer sources a product from only one provider. We find
that these relationships –even if only existent for a small number of products and countries–
are associated with lower import prices, and could therefore be costlier to break. Finally, for
European economies, the positive impact of concentration on import prices is less pronounced
in the intra-EU market, which points again at the special role of the single market in shaping
EU countries’ trade relations.
The next section reviews the literature related to the present study. Section 3details the
trade data and the trade dependency indicators used in the analysis, while section 4introduces
the empirical strategy behind panel estimations. Section 5presents a number of stylized facts on
the evolution of import concentration and other trade dependency dimensions. Empirical results
on the impact of concentration on import prices, as well as a battery of robustness checks, are

2 Literature Review
This paper is related to three main strands of literature.
4A first group of works are those that study import concentration and trade dependencies at
the product level and their evolution over time. Several recent analyses of this type have been
applied to EU imports. Among these, two studies by the European Commission aim at identi-
fying goods characterized by a high dependency on extra-EU providers (European Commission,
2021; Arjona, Connell, and Herghelegiu, 2023). Similarly, Ioannou and Perez (2023) analyze EU
dependency on external suppliers for both goods and services. De Rosa, Gainsford, Pallonetto,
and Finn (2022) study EU energy dependency, while Vicard and Wibaux (2023) analyze the
evolution of EU high-dependency imports over the long term. Cadot, Carrère, and Strauss-
Kahn (2014) document an increasing trend towards import diversification for OECD economies,
followed by a slight re-concentration at the beginning of the 2000s, which is explained by the
growing importance of Chinese exports. Their very long historical perspective, starting in the
1960s, only reaches 2005, leaving out the post hyper-globalization phase. Arriola, Cai, Kowalski,
Miroudot, and van Tongeren (2024) find that OECD countries display a high degree of depen-
dency with respect to major non-OECD economies, and in particular with respect to China as
concerns imports of strategic products. Jean, Reshef, Santoni, and Vicard (2023) also document
that China is the leading provider of many categories of goods at the world level. Vivoda (2009),
on his part, studies the concentration of oil imports of major economies, finding that only some
of them have managed to achieve an effective diversification. Cadot, Carrère, and Strauss-Kahn
(2011) and Cadot, Carrère, and Strauss-Kahn (2013) analyze instead the concentration of ex-
ports and its relationship with economic development. Ilkova, Lebastard, and Serafini (2024),
on their part, study the reshaping of euro area and US imports after 2016, highlighting some
re-orientation of flows towards a larger number of providers, which, in some cases, tends to be
associated to higher prices.
The present paper borrows from these works the main methodological blocs used to quantify
import concentration and trade dependencies. Still, our analysis complements existing studies
by going beyond the European perspective adopted in most of the other works; by analyzing
heterogeneity across sectors and groups of importers; by covering both the hyper-globalization
and the following so-called “slow-balization” phase; by taking into account the political distance
between the importer and the provider so as to quantify the vulnerability to sudden interruptions
in trade flows related to potential geopolitical strains; and, for European countries, by analyzing
the concentration of both intra and extra-EU trade flows.
A second group of related papers are those that investigate competition, economies of scale
and firms’ market power in domestic markets. De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020), Autor,
Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and van Reenen (2017), Haskel and Westlake (2017), Crouzet and Eberly
(2019), Eeckhout and Veldkamp (2022), Choi, Levchenko, Ruzic, and Shim (2024), Syverson
(2019) and Cavalleri, Eliet, McAdam, Petroulakis, Soares, and Vansteenkiste (2019) are only
some examples of the papers that belong to this vast literature. Among these works, the one
that is closer to us is perhaps Covarrubias et al. (2020), who investigate whether the increase
in production concentration observed in the US is associated to the presence of economies of
scale/pro-competitive effects (in which case market concentration is optimal) or to distortions
that tend to hamper competition (leading to a distortionary type of concentration), finding

ports and its relationship with economic development. Ilkova, Lebastard, and Serafini (2024),
on their part, study the reshaping of euro area and US imports after 2016, highlighting some
re-orientation of flows towards a larger number of providers, which, in some cases, tends to be
associated to higher prices.
The present paper borrows from these works the main methodological blocs used to quantify
import concentration and trade dependencies. Still, our analysis complements existing studies
by going beyond the European perspective adopted in most of the other works; by analyzing
heterogeneity across sectors and groups of importers; by covering both the hyper-globalization
and the following so-called “slow-balization” phase; by taking into account the political distance
between the importer and the provider so as to quantify the vulnerability to sudden interruptions
in trade flows related to potential geopolitical strains; and, for European countries, by analyzing
the concentration of both intra and extra-EU trade flows.
A second group of related papers are those that investigate competition, economies of scale
and firms’ market power in domestic markets. De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020), Autor,
Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and van Reenen (2017), Haskel and Westlake (2017), Crouzet and Eberly
(2019), Eeckhout and Veldkamp (2022), Choi, Levchenko, Ruzic, and Shim (2024), Syverson
(2019) and Cavalleri, Eliet, McAdam, Petroulakis, Soares, and Vansteenkiste (2019) are only
some examples of the papers that belong to this vast literature. Among these works, the one
that is closer to us is perhaps Covarrubias et al. (2020), who investigate whether the increase
in production concentration observed in the US is associated to the presence of economies of
scale/pro-competitive effects (in which case market concentration is optimal) or to distortions
that tend to hamper competition (leading to a distortionary type of concentration), finding
5that the increase in US firms’ production concentration tends to be associated mostly to a
lower competition.4The present paper studies a similar issue but from an international trade
perspective, that is, referring to the concentration of external providers in a country’s imports
rather than to the concentration of production in the domestic market. We document that
in foreign destination markets an increase in observed concentration tends to be associated to
higher prices, thus signaling a relatively low competition environment.
To the best of our knowledge only one paper focuses, as we do, on the relationship between
the concentration of external providers and import prices. Namely, Bonfiglioli et al. (2021) study
how the concentration of exporters within each origin country correlates to their export prices to
the US, finding that a high concentration of exporters within each origin is associated to lower
export prices to the US and to other pro-competitive effects. In the present paper, we study
instead how the concentration of a country’s imports across different origin countries impacts its
import prices –not only in the US, but in a variety of OECD markets. Contrary to what found
byBonfiglioli et al. (2021) relative to firms’ concentration within the same origin country, we
document that highly concentrated imports at the partner country level tend to be associated to
a low level of competition. This seems to suggest that firms located in different countries might
face heterogeneous possibilities to access foreign markets –either due to geographical distance,
tariff and non-tariff barriers, etc.– so that, across providers settled in different origin countries
pro-competitive forces could be more limited than across firms located in the same origin country.
A third group of related works are those that study the impact of international trade on
domestic producer prices and markups. Several works (Chen, Imbs, and Scott, 2004; Bugamelli,
Fabiani, and Sette, 2010; Auer and Fischer, 2021; Auer, Degen, and Fischer, 2013; Mandel,
2013; Carluccio, Gautier, and Guilloux-Nefussi, ????; Jaravel and Sager, 2019) have analyzed
the effect of import competition on domestic prices, generally finding a negative relationship.
We study instead the impact that a higher diversification of foreign exporters has on import
prices, finding additional evidence for the price-reducing effect of competition.

values are a widely used measure for prices at the disaggregated level.7Both trade flows and
trade unit values are free on board (FOB), i.e. exclusive of transport costs (cost, insurance,
freight). We use the HS96-version of the BACI and the TUV database, updated in 2024, to cover
the longest available time horizon. Using an older version of HS comes at the cost of slightly
reducing the number of products.8HS96 BACI spans the period from 1996 to 2022, while HS96
TUV only covers the years from 2000 to 2019. The time dimension of our empirical analysis
studying the connection between import concentration and import prices is therefore 2000-2019

trade dependencies of strategic goods, we use instead the more recent HS17 classification, which
only begins in 2017 but allows to precisely identify some newer products related to the digital
and green transition, such as electric and hybrid vehicles. All data are in annual frequency. As
for the identification of strategic goods, we consider three different (and partially overlapping)
classifications. The identification of advanced technology products –mainly high-tech. goods,
chemical products and medicines– follows the US Census.9Green technology goods are defined
as the green transition-related products in IRC (2024), belonging to the machinery, electrical,

in our sample cover about 56 %of total world imports in 2022. They remain, of course, still
heterogeneous in terms of their size, their geographical situation and their trade specialization,
which will have a potential influence on their trade relations.
6We use trade unit values from the TUV database instead of deriving these trade unit values ourselves from
values and quantities in the BACI database at the HS6 level, because bilateral trade unit values in TUV are
computed at a very high level of disaggregation before aggregation into HS6, which reduces the statistical biases
related to these data, as explained in (Berthou and Emlinger, 2011).
7Potential shortcomings of trade unit values compared to other trade price indices are the non-consideration
of possible quality effects and a general lower reporting quality of quantities (which are used to calculate unit
values), see for example Berthou and Emlinger (2011) and Miao and Wegner (2022). However, other price indices
would have other shortcomings, such as the utilization of different methodologies to achieve quality corrections.

BANCO DE ESPAÑA12 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2503 3.2 Trade dependency indicators
We study the evolution of trade dependencies in our sample of importers using a set of indices.
Our central indicator of trade dependency is import concentration. Import concentration
at the importer-product-year level is measured through the Herfindahl-Hirschman index
(HHI), based on the (squared) shares of exporters in each country’s imports at the HS6-product
level, as in European Commission (2021), Ioannou and Perez (2023) and Arjona et al. (2023).
Namely, for each product pcat the HS6-level, we measure the concentration of importer’s imp
imports (gross trade flows as defined in section 3.1) as12:
HHIpc
imp=E∑
exp=1(
Spc
imp,exp)2
(1)
where Spc
imp,exp is the share of country imp imports of product pccoming from country exp
in the total imports of product pcof country imp. The HHI ranges from 0 to 1, with highly
concentrated imports resulting in a higher value of the index. A HHI very close to zero indicates
that a country imports a certain product from a continuum of providers, each supplying a very
small share. Conversely, a HHI equal to 1 represents a case of extreme concentration, in which
an importer sources a product from one trading partner only. For EU countries, we further
distinguish between concentration in the extra-EU and in the intra-EU market, by computing
the same indicator over the two alternative sets of trade flows.
The importer-product-year level HHIs are aggregated at the level of the importer country
through a weighted sum of the concentration indices of all the goods imported by the country,
using as weights products’ shares in the country’s total imports. The import concentration
at the country level is computed as:
HHI imp=∑PC
pc=1HHIpc
imp∗Mpc
imp∑PC
pc=1Mpc
imp(2)
where Mpc
impdenotes imports of country imp of product pcandPCindicates the total number
of products imported.
Each country-level HHI can also be partitioned in bilateral concentration indices, showing
the contribution of different providers to the overall import concentration of a country. The
bilateral concentration of country imp imports coming from country expis computed as:

7trade unit values from the CEPII-TUV database (Berthou and Emlinger, 2011).6Trade unit
values are a widely used measure for prices at the disaggregated level.7Both trade flows and
trade unit values are free on board (FOB), i.e. exclusive of transport costs (cost, insurance,
freight). We use the HS96-version of the BACI and the TUV database, updated in 2024, to cover
the longest available time horizon. Using an older version of HS comes at the cost of slightly
reducing the number of products.8HS96 BACI spans the period from 1996 to 2022, while HS96
TUV only covers the years from 2000 to 2019. The time dimension of our empirical analysis
studying the connection between import concentration and import prices is therefore 2000-2019
(20 years). Instead, the analysis of the evolution of trade dependencies, based exclusively on
BACI data, also includes the additional years from 1996 and up to 2022. As for the analysis of
trade dependencies of strategic goods, we use instead the more recent HS17 classification, which
only begins in 2017 but allows to precisely identify some newer products related to the digital
and green transition, such as electric and hybrid vehicles. All data are in annual frequency. As
for the identification of strategic goods, we consider three different (and partially overlapping)
classifications. The identification of advanced technology products –mainly high-tech. goods,
chemical products and medicines– follows the US Census.9Green technology goods are defined
as the green transition-related products in IRC (2024), belonging to the machinery, electrical,
electronic, and transport sectors. Semiconductors are identified as in Attinasi, Stefani, Frohm,
Gunnella, Koester, Melemenidis, and Tóth (2021).
Table 13in appendix Adetails the data and classifications used as well as their sources;
table 14provides summary statistics.
We focus our analysis on the 38 OECD countries plus the 5 non-OECD EU economies10,
which form our set of importers. The trading partners (or exporters) include the whole world.
Focusing our analysis on OECD countries allows to have relatively similar economies in terms
of their development status and their reliability of trade data in the sample.11The importers
in our sample cover about 56 %of total world imports in 2022. They remain, of course, still
heterogeneous in terms of their size, their geographical situation and their trade specialization,
which will have a potential influence on their trade relations.
6We use trade unit values from the TUV database instead of deriving these trade unit values ourselves from
values and quantities in the BACI database at the HS6 level, because bilateral trade unit values in TUV are
computed at a very high level of disaggregation before aggregation into HS6, which reduces the statistical biases
related to these data, as explained in (Berthou and Emlinger, 2011).
7Potential shortcomings of trade unit values compared to other trade price indices are the non-consideration
of possible quality effects and a general lower reporting quality of quantities (which are used to calculate unit
values), see for example Berthou and Emlinger (2011) and Miao and Wegner (2022). However, other price indices
would have other shortcomings, such as the utilization of different methodologies to achieve quality corrections.
8According to CEPII, the conversion process from newer to older revisions for data originally expressed in a
more recent revision reduces the number of products present in the data. Still, the number of trade flows recorded
in BACI does not differ much across revisions.

BANCO DE ESPAÑA13 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2503 3.2 Trade dependency indicators
We study the evolution of trade dependencies in our sample of importers using a set of indices.
Our central indicator of trade dependency is import concentration. Import concentration
at the importer-product-year level is measured through the Herfindahl-Hirschman index
(HHI), based on the (squared) shares of exporters in each country’s imports at the HS6-product
level, as in European Commission (2021), Ioannou and Perez (2023) and Arjona et al. (2023).
Namely, for each product pcat the HS6-level, we measure the concentration of importer’s imp
imports (gross trade flows as defined in section 3.1) as12:
HHIpc
imp=E∑
exp=1(
Spc
imp,exp)2
(1)
where Spc
imp,exp is the share of country imp imports of product pccoming from country exp
in the total imports of product pcof country imp. The HHI ranges from 0 to 1, with highly
concentrated imports resulting in a higher value of the index. A HHI very close to zero indicates
that a country imports a certain product from a continuum of providers, each supplying a very
small share. Conversely, a HHI equal to 1 represents a case of extreme concentration, in which
an importer sources a product from one trading partner only. For EU countries, we further
distinguish between concentration in the extra-EU and in the intra-EU market, by computing
the same indicator over the two alternative sets of trade flows.
The importer-product-year level HHIs are aggregated at the level of the importer country
through a weighted sum of the concentration indices of all the goods imported by the country,
using as weights products’ shares in the country’s total imports. The import concentration
at the country level is computed as:
HHI imp=∑PC
pc=1HHIpc
imp∗Mpc
imp∑PC
pc=1Mpc
imp(2)
where Mpc
impdenotes imports of country imp of product pcandPCindicates the total number
of products imported.
Each country-level HHI can also be partitioned in bilateral concentration indices, showing
the contribution of different providers to the overall import concentration of a country. The
bilateral concentration of country imp imports coming from country expis computed as:
12For simplicity, we do not report the sub-index tfor a given year in this section.
83.2 Trade dependency indicators
We study the evolution of trade dependencies in our sample of importers using a set of indices.
Our central indicator of trade dependency is import concentration. Import concentration
at the importer-product-year level is measured through the Herfindahl-Hirschman index
(HHI), based on the (squared) shares of exporters in each country’s imports at the HS6-product
level, as in European Commission (2021), Ioannou and Perez (2023) and Arjona et al. (2023).

where Spc
imp,exp is the share of country imp imports of product pccoming from country exp
in the total imports of product pcof country imp. The HHI ranges from 0 to 1, with highly
concentrated imports resulting in a higher value of the index. A HHI very close to zero indicates
that a country imports a certain product from a continuum of providers, each supplying a very
small share. Conversely, a HHI equal to 1 represents a case of extreme concentration, in which
an importer sources a product from one trading partner only. For EU countries, we further
distinguish between concentration in the extra-EU and in the intra-EU market, by computing
the same indicator over the two alternative sets of trade flows.
The importer-product-year level HHIs are aggregated at the level of the importer country
through a weighted sum of the concentration indices of all the goods imported by the country,
using as weights products’ shares in the country’s total imports. The import concentration
at the country level is computed as:
HHI imp=∑PC

imp∗Mpc
imp∑PC
pc=1Mpc
imp(2)
where Mpc
impdenotes imports of country imp of product pcandPCindicates the total number
of products imported.
Each country-level HHI can also be partitioned in bilateral concentration indices, showing
the contribution of different providers to the overall import concentration of a country. The
bilateral concentration of country imp imports coming from country expis computed as:
12For simplicity, we do not report the sub-index tfor a given year in this section.

imp∑PC
pc=1Mpc
imp(3)
where p_max denotes the products for which country expis the major exporter to country imp,
andP_max is their total number.
For each importer, product and year, we also calculate a politically-distance weighted ver-
sion of the import concentration index, built using the geopolitical distance measure of Bailey,
Strezhnev, and Voeten (2017), based on countries’ votes on human right issues in United Nations
assemblies. The politically-distance weighted HHI allows to measure countries’ vulnerability to
potential interruptions in trade flows related to geopolitical tensions and is calculated as:

impis the political distance measure of Bailey et al. (2017), based on countries’
United Nations votes on human rights, averaged across 5 years and centered so that its mean
value –computed across all importers, exporters and years– is equal to one.
We complement import concentration with two other trade dependency indicators, namely
the centrality of exporters and an external reliance indicator. The centrality of exporters
indicator is defined at the product-year level and constitutes a measure of concentration of
providers/exporters within a network (Korniyenko, Pinat, and Dew, 2017)13, which quantifies
the probability that a certain product is provided by just a few central suppliers at the world
level, thus proxying the potential for diversification across exporting countries. For each product,
it is based on the dispersion, across different suppliers, of the value of world exports provided
by distinct exporters. Namely, it is defined as the standard deviation, across all exporters exp,
of the weighted outdegree centrality of exporters:

where wpc
imp,exp is the value of exports of country expto country imp of product pc, and wavpc

of country imp’s imports of the same product. Products that are provided by just a few large
exporters at the world level score higher at the centrality indicator, signaling that these goods
feature a lower diversification potential at the global level.

13Bonneau and Nakaa (2020) also employ this indicator as a measure of trade dependency.
9Finally, the external reliance indicator , defined at the importer-product-year-level, is
computed, for each product, importer and year, as the ratio between imports and exports, as in
European Commission (2021). Exports proxy domestic production, which is not available at the
disaggregated HS6 level. For each product pc, we measure the external dependency of importer
imp as the ratio of imp’s imports over imp’s exports:
Extdeppc
imp=Mpc
imp/Xpc
imp (6)
where Mpc
impandXpc
impare, respectively, imports and exports of country imp of product pc. We
also calculate a dummy variable from this indicator, which is 1 when the ratio between imports
and exports >1, i.e. when a country is importing more than it is exporting of a given product,
and 0 otherwise. Higher imports than exports signal that a country would not be able to
substitute its imports of a given good by reducing its own exports, thus identifying an economy
that is dependent on its external providers for the internal consumption of this particular good.
We consider country imp to be externally dependent as for the provision of product pc, if
Extdeppc
imp>1.
4 Empirical strategy
In order to study the impact of import concentration on import prices, we compute, as a first
step, a relative price index at the importer-product-year level. For each product, importer
and year, the relative price is computed as the ratio of the average price paid for this product
by a given importer imp (across all providers exp) compared to the average price paid for the
same product by all importers, at the HS6-level14:

while a value of Ppc

and a given year. Using relative instead of absolute prices has the advantage of analyzing prices
in comparison to a reference group. General price trends are thus levelled out.

the average.

HHI i,tis the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, as defined in eq. 1. The slope coefficient βquantifies
the impact of import concentration on relative import prices, and constitutes our main object
of interest. Its estimation allows to determine whether the fact that a country’s imports of
a certain product are highly concentrated, implies that it is paying a higher price for it with
respect to the price that is paid for the same product by the other importers.
Importantly, we explicitly control for additional variables that can have a potential impact on
import prices beyond the one exerted by import concentration (gdp imp,t,rvtf i,t, and gdp_exp i,t
in eq.8). In particular, we control for the logarithm of real GDP per capita (in constant prices,
at PPP) of importer imp (gdp imp,t), which reflects the income level of importers and allows to
take into account that higher income countries are generally characterized by a higher price level
(see, for example, Hassan, 2016). This variable also controls for the fact that more developed
countries tend to import higher quality and hence more expensive goods, as demonstrated by
Feenstra and Romalis (2014). It controls hence also implicitly for the quality of products.15
We also take into account, indirectly, the labor cost of the providers, in order to control for
the integration in world markets of exporters with low labor costs, such as China and other
Asian economies, which, as shown by the literature, tended to depress import prices of advanced
economies (Amiti, Dai, Feenstra, and Romalis, 2020; Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler, 2006).
As labor costs are not available for the more than 200 countries that constitute our universe
of exporters, we proxy them with the GDP per capita of providers, at constant prices in USD,
which is highly correlated with labor costs in a cross-section for which labor costs are available.16
For each importer, product and year, the GDP per capita of exporters is weighted with the share
of each provider in a country’s imports a certain good ( gdp_exp i,t). This allows us to control
for the effect that the change of the composition from higher wage to lower wage providers could
have had on relative import prices.17
Besides, we control for the market power of the importer country, by calculating the share
of a given importer in total imports for each product ( rvtf i,t). This allows us to test whether a
higher (lower) import concentration has a downward (upward) effect on import prices considering
15In the robustness section, we also test for the influence of market size of importers using total GDP (in
constant prices, in USD & PPP) and total population.
16We use per capita GDP in PPP terms for importers, as we are interested in the purchasing power effect on
prices, while we use per capita GDP in USD for exporters as we take GDP here as a proxy for wage or labor
costs.
17Edwards and Lawrence (2010) also find a positive association between a country’s GDP per capita and its
weighted average price of exports to the United States.

16We use per capita GDP in PPP terms for importers, as we are interested in the purchasing power effect on
prices, while we use per capita GDP in USD for exporters as we take GDP here as a proxy for wage or labor
costs.

11data model, which takes the following general form:
Pi,t=α+β·HHI i,t+γ·gdp imp,t+δ·rvtf i,t+η·gdp_exp i,t+ζ·Zi,t+µi+θt+ϵi,t,(8)
where the subscript tindicates the time period (t =1, ...,20) and ithe importer-specific product.
Namely, iis the combination of the importer impand the product pcat the HS6-level, imp#pc .
Pi,tstands for the relative import price, that is, the ratio of the average import price of importer
impfor a given product at the HS6-level pccompared to the average price of pcover all importers.
HHI i,tis the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, as defined in eq. 1. The slope coefficient βquantifies
the impact of import concentration on relative import prices, and constitutes our main object
of interest. Its estimation allows to determine whether the fact that a country’s imports of
a certain product are highly concentrated, implies that it is paying a higher price for it with
respect to the price that is paid for the same product by the other importers.
Importantly, we explicitly control for additional variables that can have a potential impact on
import prices beyond the one exerted by import concentration (gdp imp,t,rvtf i,t, and gdp_exp i,t
in eq.8). In particular, we control for the logarithm of real GDP per capita (in constant prices,
at PPP) of importer imp (gdp imp,t), which reflects the income level of importers and allows to
take into account that higher income countries are generally characterized by a higher price level
(see, for example, Hassan, 2016). This variable also controls for the fact that more developed
countries tend to import higher quality and hence more expensive goods, as demonstrated by
Feenstra and Romalis (2014). It controls hence also implicitly for the quality of products.15
We also take into account, indirectly, the labor cost of the providers, in order to control for
the integration in world markets of exporters with low labor costs, such as China and other
Asian economies, which, as shown by the literature, tended to depress import prices of advanced
economies (Amiti, Dai, Feenstra, and Romalis, 2020; Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler, 2006).
As labor costs are not available for the more than 200 countries that constitute our universe
of exporters, we proxy them with the GDP per capita of providers, at constant prices in USD,
which is highly correlated with labor costs in a cross-section for which labor costs are available.16
For each importer, product and year, the GDP per capita of exporters is weighted with the share
of each provider in a country’s imports a certain good ( gdp_exp i,t). This allows us to control
for the effect that the change of the composition from higher wage to lower wage providers could
have had on relative import prices.17
Besides, we control for the market power of the importer country, by calculating the share
of a given importer in total imports for each product ( rvtf i,t). This allows us to test whether a
higher (lower) import concentration has a downward (upward) effect on import prices considering

We estimate the model using the fixed effect (FE) estimator. The Hausman test (Hausman,
1978) rejected the null hypothesis of random effects. We always include time fixed effects to the
model, as the Wald-test indicates that time indicators are jointly significant.18We also test for
serial and cross-sectional correlation of the residuals.19As these tests detect some serial and
cross-sectional correlation among residuals, we provide autocorrelation-, heteroskedasticity- and
cross-sectional dependence-consistent Driscoll-Kraay (DK) standard errors (Driscoll and Kraay,
1998).20
Concerning the choice of the fixed effect structure, in our baseline model we use interacted
FE at the importer-product level to control for time-invariant country-product specific charac-
teristics, such as product quality or product complexity at the importer level, and time FE to
control for common time trends. For the time varying part, we try alternative specifications
including the product complexity index (at the product level) and the economic complexity in-
dex (at the importer level), as well as an interaction of both. In the robustness section 6.6, we
employ three alternative FE structures to test for the sensitivity of our results to the chosen FE
structure.
To test for the presence of non-linearities, in particular for the inverted U-shaped relationship

cautious with applying this estimator to panel datasets with a large number of units but a small number of
observations over time, we also compute and cross-check our results with clustered or "Roger" standard errors.

5 Stylized facts on trade dependencies and their evolution
In this section, we use the trade dependency indicators outlined in section 3.2to derive some
stylized facts on OECD countries’ trade dependencies and their evolution over the last two
decades.
Import concentration varies widely across importers, being lower in EU countries
and higher in middle-income countries . Concentration varies widely across countries,
ranging, in 2022, from a minimum HHI at the country level of 0.2 for Italy to a maximum
of 0.5 for Mexico (Figure 1). Intuitively, this corresponds, in the case of Italy, to an average
number of 32 providers per product category; the main trade partner for each product category
holding, on average, a 43% market share. At the other extreme of the concentration spectrum,
Mexico features an average of 16 providers per product line, and the top provider is responsible
on average for 66% of imports. EU economies imports are less concentrated with respect to
other advanced countries’, with EU largest four economies (Germany, France, Italy and Spain)
displaying the lowest level of concentration. Middle-income OECD countries feature, on the
contrary, the highest levels of concentration. EU economies’ higher diversification tends to stem
from the intensive margin, as they import from the same average number of importers as other
advanced countries, but the share they import from the top provider tends to be lower. Middle-

and their top provider is responsible for a higher share of imports.
For most economies, China represents one of the most important sources of
concentrated imports . Concentration indexes can be partitioned into the contribution of
individual providers to total import concentration, as explained in section 3.2. At the bilateral
level, imports tend to be more concentrated in geographically close providers as well as in
trade partners with whom a preferential trade agreement is in force (Figure 2). Still, for most
economies, a significant share of import concentration is with respect to China, which constitutes
either the first or the second most important source of concentrated imports for the majority of
importers in our sample.
At the sectoral level, imports tend to be more concentrated in primary sectors,
such as mineral and agricultural products, with respect to manufactures . On average,
while the mineral product sector featured in 2022 an HHI of 0.47–corresponding to an average
of 12 providers and a 66% share of the top exporter—, among the sectors at the other hand of
the spectrum, the machinery and electronic industry, featured an HHI of 0.25, with an average
of 30 providers and a 46% share provided, on average, by the top one. Overall, distinguishing
sectors according to their technological level, as in Lall (2000), shows that primary products
tend to feature the highest import concentration, while high and medium-tech. manufactures
exhibit the lowest concentration levels. As concerns goods position in production chains, inter-
mediate products’ imports –especially food’s and minerals’– are more concentrated with respect
to consumption and capital goods.
The hyper-globalization period resulted in a generalized decrease in import con-
centration. Concentration decreased on average in our sample of importers in the last two
decades, with the fall being more pronounced between 1996 and the Global Financial Crisis, in
the so-called “hyper-globalization” phase, than in the following “slow-balization” period (Figure
3). In the hyper-globalization years, the decrease was generalized across all country groups, al-
though it was particularly pronounced in middle income economies. The slow-balization period,
on the contrary, was characterized by heterogeneous dynamics across country groups, as con-
centration kept decreasing on average for EU economies, while it stagnated in other advanced
countries and slightly increased back in emerging countries. A small increase in concentration
was observed during the pandemics years. At the sectoral level, the decrease in concentration
observed since 1996 was due to a decline in import concentration within sectors –especially in
the transport, textiles, machinery and electronic industries, that is, in the sectors that feature
nowadays the lowest concentration levels— rather than to import switching towards sectors with
less concentrated imports. At the bilateral level, for the average EU country, import concen-
tration decreased mostly vis-à-vis other EU members, while for other advanced economies and
middle income countries, concentration diminished mostly vis-à-vis the US. On the other hand,
the integration of China in global markets contributed –everything else equal— to increase the
import concentration of all groups of importers.

For EU countries, integration in the single market was crucial to foster import
diversification in the slow-balization period . Among EU members, the decrease in import
concentration in the hyper-globalization years was due both to a higher diversification in the
intra-EU and in the extra-EU market (Figure 4). Still, in the slow-balization years, only diver-
sification in the internal market took place –away from Germany, Italy and France and towards
newly integrated providers like Poland and Bulgaria.
Import concentration may have different implications for importers’ vulnerabil-
ity depending on other dimensions of trade dependency. In what follows we will focus
on three of them. First, the more distant –from a geopolitical point of view— the importer and
its main providers, the more vulnerable, for each degree of import concentration, its imports.
Second, import concentration implies a higher vulnerability if countries are externally dependent
for product sourcing, that is, if their imports of a certain product exceed the internal production
that is exported abroad, so that, in case of an interruption in import flows, these cannot be
substituted for by reducing exports. Finally, import concentration results in a higher vulnera-
bility in the case of goods whose production, either for geographical or industrial development
circumstances, is restricted to a few global producers.
Although import concentration decreased in the last two decades, imports tended
to switch towards more politically-distant providers due to the growing importance
of China. The political distance-weighted concentration index, as defined in 3.2, decreased less

America—, the politically-weighted index decreased more than its non-weighted counterpart, as
imports switched away from the US, which is far from some of these economies from a political
point of view, and towards some other Latin American countries, like Brazil and Argentina,

Still, nowadays the EU internal market keeps providing a shield from the vul-
nerability that arises due to strongly concentrated imports in politically distant

19ucts, that is, those goods whose imports cannot be fully substituted for by reducing
exports . On average in our sample of importers, externally dependent goods –as defined in 3.2–
account for 75% of products and 80% of import value in 2022, being higher in other advanced
economies and middle income countries than in the average EU country (Figure 6). Globaliza-
tion brought about a small increase in external dependency in terms of the share of imported
products that cannot be fully substituted for by reducing exports. Interestingly, the different
dependencies reinforce each other, as externally dependent products tend to exhibit a slightly
higher degree of import concentration than non-externally dependent types of imports.
Still, the share of goods characterized by a high import vulnerability –that is,
those with both highly concentrated and externally dependent imports— decreased
over time, being lower in EU countries and higher in middle-income ones. The gener-
alized decrease in import concentration observed in the last two decades, implied a reduction in
the share of highly vulnerable products over time, as defined accordingly to the European Com-
mission methodology (European Commission (2021)), as those characterized by a relatively high
degree of import concentration (a HHI > 0.4) and by external dependency (imports exceeding
own exports).25Although these goods are pretty much evenly distributed across industries, the
sectors that feature the most are the mineral, animal and chemical products ones. Importers dif-
fer widely in the share of highly vulnerable products, which is lower, on average, in EU countries,
where they constituted 18% of imports in 2022, and higher in OECD middle-income economies,
where this share exceeds 40%.
China is the leading global provider of the majority of the goods whose produc-
tion, at the world level, is highly concentrated in a few exporters . A high import
concentration also implies a higher vulnerability for the importer in the case of those goods
whose production, at the world level, is highly concentrated in a few exporters, as diversification
opportunities are hampered. We quantify such probability using an index of centrality of ex-
porters, defined at the product level as in 3.2. At the global level, the probability of facing a few
leading exporters tends to be higher in the footwear, machinery and plastic sectors –industries
in which the centrality of exporters measure belongs to the 3rdand 4thquartiles of the overall
distribution for more than 70% of products (Figure 7). At the other end of the spectrum, pri-
mary products, with more than 90% of goods belonging to the lowest centrality quartiles. The
goods with a very high concentration at the production level –in the top 10% of the centrality
distribution— mostly belong to the machinery and electronic, textile and metal industries, like
some types of fabric, turbines and circuits, and alloys. For the vast majority of them, the leading
global exporter is China. Several of these products also represent raw materials whose resources
are particularly concentrated in a few countries, like tungsten, uranium and lithium.26
The imports of critical products –advanced technology goods, technologies nec-
essary for the green transition, and semiconductors— are particularly concentrated
25Being applied to the EU bloc, the European Commission methodology takes into account a third dependency
dimension, that is, the scarcity of a product in the internal EU market. Given that our sample of importers goes
beyond EU countries, we do not present results for this metric.
26Some of the so-called “critical raw materials”, like rare earths, germanium or gallium, whose world top exporter
is China, cannot be precisely identified at the HS6 level of disaggregation.

exports . On average in our sample of importers, externally dependent goods –as defined in 3.2–
account for 75% of products and 80% of import value in 2022, being higher in other advanced
economies and middle income countries than in the average EU country (Figure 6). Globaliza-
tion brought about a small increase in external dependency in terms of the share of imported
products that cannot be fully substituted for by reducing exports. Interestingly, the different
dependencies reinforce each other, as externally dependent products tend to exhibit a slightly
higher degree of import concentration than non-externally dependent types of imports.
Still, the share of goods characterized by a high import vulnerability –that is,
those with both highly concentrated and externally dependent imports— decreased
over time, being lower in EU countries and higher in middle-income ones. The gener-
alized decrease in import concentration observed in the last two decades, implied a reduction in
the share of highly vulnerable products over time, as defined accordingly to the European Com-
mission methodology (European Commission (2021)), as those characterized by a relatively high
degree of import concentration (a HHI > 0.4) and by external dependency (imports exceeding
own exports).25Although these goods are pretty much evenly distributed across industries, the
sectors that feature the most are the mineral, animal and chemical products ones. Importers dif-
fer widely in the share of highly vulnerable products, which is lower, on average, in EU countries,
where they constituted 18% of imports in 2022, and higher in OECD middle-income economies,
where this share exceeds 40%.
China is the leading global provider of the majority of the goods whose produc-

concentration also implies a higher vulnerability for the importer in the case of those goods
whose production, at the world level, is highly concentrated in a few exporters, as diversification
opportunities are hampered. We quantify such probability using an index of centrality of ex-
porters, defined at the product level as in 3.2. At the global level, the probability of facing a few
leading exporters tends to be higher in the footwear, machinery and plastic sectors –industries
in which the centrality of exporters measure belongs to the 3rdand 4thquartiles of the overall
distribution for more than 70% of products (Figure 7). At the other end of the spectrum, pri-

in column (2) & (4) include a quadratic term to capture possible non-linear effects of import
concentration on prices.
All variables in the baseline model are significant determinants of relative import prices and
have the expected sign. Our main variable of interest, the concentration index HHI , shows
a significant (at the 1% significance level) impact of import concentration on relative import
prices (column (1)). Everything else equal, countries whose imports of a certain product are
more concentrated, tend to pay a higher price for this product compared to other importers with
less concentrated imports. This is consistent with the idea that highly concentrated markets
feature a lower level of competition, resulting in higher import prices. We also find evidence
for non-linearities in the impact of concentration, namely for the fact that the positive impact
of concentration on prices tends to diminish at higher levels of concentration, as the quadratic
term of HHI is significantly negative (at the 1% significance level) (column (2)). That means
that concentration and prices co-move positively up to a certain threshold of concentration,
beyond which the relationship between concentration and prices turns negative. The turning
point is reached at a concentration index of about 0.627, which represents a strongly concentrated
market.
Columns (3) and (4) of table 1show specifications including a dummy variable for exclusive
trade relations, that is, those cases in which an importer sources a certain product from only
one provider. We find that the dummy variable for exclusive trade relations is highly significant
(at the 1% significance level). Sourcing imports from one exclusive exporter decreases the price
level of a given product by about 0.13 point compared to the price paid by other importers for
the same product, which makes exclusive trade relations costly to break. The downward impact
of exclusive relations on prices could be due to a variety of factors, such as the stickiness of

these relationships, the pervasiveness of highly-tailored products, or to transfers of knowledge
between the exporter and the importer. Controlling for these relations has an impact on the
size of the coefficient of the concentration index. In the linear model (column (3)), the size of
the coefficient of HHI almost doubles, implying that an increase of concentration by 0.1 point
increases relative import prices by about 0.01 point. Also, the non-linearities that we found in
column (2) seem to be actually due to the presence of these relations, as they lose significance
when we add the dummy that identifies them, in column (4).
Concerning the other explanatory variables, an importer with a higher level of development
as proxied by its GDP (gdp in equation 8) tends to pay a higher price, most likely because it
is importing higher-quality products. Conversely, an importer that has a higher market power
as a buyer because it is importing a large share of a product ( rvtf in equation 8), is getting
a lower price, which is also consistent with what trade theory predicts. Finally, an importer
that is sourcing a product from a set of providers with higher labor costs, as proxied by their
GDP (gdp _exp in8), tends to pay a higher price, which is consistent with the results of a large
literature that studies the impact of China’s integration in world markets ( Amiti et al., 2020;
Kamin et al., 2006).

All variables in the baseline model are significant determinants of relative import prices and
have the expected sign. Our main variable of interest, the concentration index HHI , shows
a significant (at the 1% significance level) impact of import concentration on relative import
prices (column (1)). Everything else equal, countries whose imports of a certain product are
more concentrated, tend to pay a higher price for this product compared to other importers with
less concentrated imports. This is consistent with the idea that highly concentrated markets
feature a lower level of competition, resulting in higher import prices. We also find evidence
for non-linearities in the impact of concentration, namely for the fact that the positive impact
of concentration on prices tends to diminish at higher levels of concentration, as the quadratic
term of HHI is significantly negative (at the 1% significance level) (column (2)). That means
that concentration and prices co-move positively up to a certain threshold of concentration,
beyond which the relationship between concentration and prices turns negative. The turning
point is reached at a concentration index of about 0.627, which represents a strongly concentrated
market.

trade relations, that is, those cases in which an importer sources a certain product from only
one provider. We find that the dummy variable for exclusive trade relations is highly significant
(at the 1% significance level). Sourcing imports from one exclusive exporter decreases the price
level of a given product by about 0.13 point compared to the price paid by other importers for
the same product, which makes exclusive trade relations costly to break. The downward impact
of exclusive relations on prices could be due to a variety of factors, such as the stickiness of

BANCO DE ESPAÑA29 DOCUMENTO DE TRABAJO N.º 2503 To sum up, baseline results show that, across OECD and EU countries, import concentration
at the product level tends to be associated with higher import prices, which is compatible with
the view that a high concentration is associated to an environment of low competition. This
effect is counterbalanced at very high concentration levels by the dampening effect of exclusive

ogy intensity, as specified in the classification of Lall (2000). This classification distinguishes
non-processed (primary) goods and processed goods, and the processed goods further based
on the technological know-how needed for processing them (resource-based manufactures, low-
technology manufactures, medium-technology manufactures and high-technology manufactures).
Next, we distinguish more detailed categories of products according to the macro classification
provided by Ioannou and Perez (2023). This allows a finer distinction of different type of primary
goods (animal, vegetable and mineral products, metals) and specific other interesting product
groups (textiles). Finally, we look at different types of products depending on their position in
the production chain. Namely, we distinguish between final goods, which are divided again into
capital and consumption goods28, and intermediate products, which are inputs in the production
process. Intermediate goods are also a frequently used proxy in the literature for trade in value
added (see, for example, Korniyenko et al., 2017).
As for the technological classification, table 2reports the results of the quadratic specification

these relationships, the pervasiveness of highly-tailored products, or to transfers of knowledge
between the exporter and the importer. Controlling for these relations has an impact on the
size of the coefficient of the concentration index. In the linear model (column (3)), the size of
the coefficient of HHI almost doubles, implying that an increase of concentration by 0.1 point
increases relative import prices by about 0.01 point. Also, the non-linearities that we found in
column (2) seem to be actually due to the presence of these relations, as they lose significance
when we add the dummy that identifies them, in column (4).
Concerning the other explanatory variables, an importer with a higher level of development
as proxied by its GDP (gdp in equation 8) tends to pay a higher price, most likely because it
is importing higher-quality products. Conversely, an importer that has a higher market power
as a buyer because it is importing a large share of a product (rvtf in equation 8), is getting
a lower price, which is also consistent with what trade theory predicts. Finally, an importer
that is sourcing a product from a set of providers with higher labor costs, as proxied by their
GDP (gdp _exp in 8), tends to pay a higher price, which is consistent with the results of a large
literature that studies the impact of China’s integration in world markets (Amiti et al., 2020;
Kamin et al., 2006).

26To sum up, baseline results show that, across OECD and EU countries, import concentration
at the product level tends to be associated with higher import prices, which is compatible with
the view that a high concentration is associated to an environment of low competition. This
effect is counterbalanced at very high concentration levels by the dampening effect of exclusive
trade relationships on relative import prices.

This section is devoted to studying whether the impact of concentration on relative prices varies
across sectors and across different type of products. In a first step, we estimate this relation-
ships for a broad classification of products according to their degree of processing or technol-
ogy intensity, as specified in the classification of Lall (2000). This classification distinguishes
non-processed (primary) goods and processed goods, and the processed goods further based
on the technological know-how needed for processing them (resource-based manufactures, low-
technology manufactures, medium-technology manufactures and high-technology manufactures).
Next, we distinguish more detailed categories of products according to the macro classification
provided by Ioannou and Perez (2023). This allows a finer distinction of different type of primary
goods (animal, vegetable and mineral products, metals) and specific other interesting product
groups (textiles). Finally, we look at different types of products depending on their position in

capital and consumption goods28, and intermediate products, which are inputs in the production
process. Intermediate goods are also a frequently used proxy in the literature for trade in value
added (see, for example, Korniyenko et al., 2017).
As for the technological classification, table 2reports the results of the quadratic specification

that euro area firms belonging to sectors that exhibit a high concentration and are categorized as
"high-tech. users", generally have higher TFP growth rates, which also hints at an association
between market concentration and pro-competitive effects in these sectors.
Another possible explanation for the lower price impact of concentration in higher tech. in-
dustries is that price competition is stronger for more standardized products than for knowledge-
intensive and differentiated manufactures, such as the products of medium and high tech. indus-
tries, as consumers could more easily substitute standardized products across different importers.
A lower substitutability and, hence, price competition in higher tech. sectors could explain the
lower impact on import prices of changes in import concentration.30
Interestingly, for high tech. products the coefficient of rvtf , the import share of global
imports of a given product, is estimated to be significant and positive, signaling that a higher
market share of the importer has an upward effect on prices. This is in contrast with what
estimated in baseline regressions and for other technological sectors, where this coefficient is
estimated to be negative. One possible explanation for the different impact of the import shares
on relative prices in the case of high tech. goods is that, being these products more specific and
knowledge-intense and therefore more difficult to substitute imports across providers, they tend
to create a greater dependency or "lock-in" effect on the importer side, with an upward effect
on prices.
A final relevant result from technological sectors regressions concerns primary products. For
the goods produced in this sector, contrary to other industries, relevant non-linearities in the
impact of concentration on prices are estimated (column (1) of 2), signaling that the positive
association between import concentration and prices tends to fade away at higher levels of
concentration –an effect that is significant even when controlling for the presence of exclusive
trade relations. This could indicate that, for these highly standardized products, at high levels of
concentration scale effects could hamper the positive impact of a low competition environment
on prices.
A look at a more granular partition of products into macro sectors, according to the macro
classification provided in Ioannou and Perez (2023), confirms these results. We find an above
average and significantly positive impact of concentration on price levels for more standardized
manufacturing products, such as food products, chemicals, plastics and rubber products, wood
and wood products, textiles, footwear, stone and glass and metal products.31The coefficient
of concentration is either significantly positive but small (in the linear model) or not significant

30Although we are not aware of any other paper that studies the price effect of market concentration at the

the degree of substitutability between varieties, i.e. between products exported by different countries into a
given destination (Fontagné, Guimbard, and Orefice, 2022). Trade elasticities differ considerably across product
groups. Fontagné et al. (2022) show that for more homogeneous products, such as mineral and chemical products
(according to the HS1-digit classification), the average trade elasticity is high as the importing country can easily
substitute imports across countries when a change in bilateral import price occurs. For differentiated products
(such as machinery and footwear) they obtain smaller values of trade elasticity.

27strongly oriented towards the high-tech sector.32For transportation products, the relationship
is negative, which is however only significant in the quadratic model. As for primary products
and commodities, we detect strong non-linearities. As mineral oil and mineral products are con-
cerned, we find that the relationship between concentration and prices is significantly positive
but decreasing in higher concentration (the quadratic term being strongly negative and signif-
icant). We observe a similar pattern for animals and animal products and vegetable products,
which exhibit a small positive or non-significant coefficient of concentration in the linear model
but much higher coefficients (positive in the linear term and negative in the quadratic term) in
the quadratic regression model (see tables 21and22in appendix B).
As concerns goods position in production chains, the regression results based on the BEC
classification, which distinguishes intermediate and final goods, reveal that the significant pos-
itive effect of market concentration on relative prices holds for intermediate goods and final
consumption goods, while the effect is negative (albeit not significant in the linear model) for
final capital goods (see table 3). The technological classification of products, discussed in detail
above, provides an explanation for this result. Indeed, high-tech. products represent about
29% of observations of final capital goods but only 5% of intermediate goods and 2% of final
consumption goods. If we run the regression for capital goods excluding high-tech. goods, the
coefficient of the concentration index becomes significantly positive.33
As far as intermediate inputs are concerned, the BEC classification allows a further distinc-
tion into food and beverages, industrial supplies, fuels and lubricants and parts and equipment.
We observe a positive and significant relationship between concentration and prices for all four
of these intermediate goods’ categories.34In absolute size, the effect is the strongest for fuels
and lubricants among intermediate goods (see column (3) of table 23in appendix B). The ef-
fect is also significant and relatively strong for industrial supplies and parts and equipment (see
columns (2) and (4) of table 23). As in the previous classifications, the relationship exhibits
strong non-linearities (inverse-U) for commodities. The coefficient of the quadratic term and
the dummy variable for one-provider relationships is particularly strong for intermediate food
products and fuels and lubricants (see columns (1) and (3) of table 24and table 25in appendix
B). Intermediate parts and equipment, the category with the highest degree of sophistication
among intermediate inputs, exhibits the lowest - and in the quadratic regression - not significant
coefficient of concentration.
6.3 Interaction with other dependency indicators
In this section, we investigate whether the impact of import concentration on prices varies
depending on other dimensions of trade dependency. We focus in particular on the centrality
of exporters –a proxy for diversification opportunities across providers at the global level–, and
32The two classifications are not fully congruent. Some of the machinery and electrical products are classified
as medium-technology and others as high-technology goods.
33The coefficient of the linear term stands at 0.346 vs. -0.013 for all capital goods and the one of the quadratic
term to -0.205 vs. 0.120 for all capital goods, both being significant at the 1 %significance level.

28strongly oriented towards the high-tech sector.32For transportation products, the relationship
is negative, which is however only significant in the quadratic model. As for primary products
and commodities, we detect strong non-linearities. As mineral oil and mineral products are con-
cerned, we find that the relationship between concentration and prices is significantly positive
but decreasing in higher concentration (the quadratic term being strongly negative and signif-
icant). We observe a similar pattern for animals and animal products and vegetable products,
which exhibit a small positive or non-significant coefficient of concentration in the linear model
but much higher coefficients (positive in the linear term and negative in the quadratic term) in
the quadratic regression model (see tables 21and22in appendix B).
As concerns goods position in production chains, the regression results based on the BEC
classification, which distinguishes intermediate and final goods, reveal that the significant pos-
itive effect of market concentration on relative prices holds for intermediate goods and final
consumption goods, while the effect is negative (albeit not significant in the linear model) for
final capital goods (see table 3). The technological classification of products, discussed in detail
above, provides an explanation for this result. Indeed, high-tech. products represent about
29% of observations of final capital goods but only 5% of intermediate goods and 2% of final
consumption goods. If we run the regression for capital goods excluding high-tech. goods, the
coefficient of the concentration index becomes significantly positive.33
As far as intermediate inputs are concerned, the BEC classification allows a further distinc-
tion into food and beverages, industrial supplies, fuels and lubricants and parts and equipment.
We observe a positive and significant relationship between concentration and prices for all four
of these intermediate goods’ categories.34In absolute size, the effect is the strongest for fuels
and lubricants among intermediate goods (see column (3) of table 23in appendix B). The ef-
fect is also significant and relatively strong for industrial supplies and parts and equipment (see
columns (2) and (4) of table 23). As in the previous classifications, the relationship exhibits

28on external reliance –identifying cases in which the importer is dependent on external suppliers
for the internal consumption of a certain product. Both indices are defined in section 3.2.
As the former indicator is product-specific but not importer-specific, we interact it with the
import concentration index to study their combined effect on relative import prices.35The
latter indicator, instead, is importer- and product-specific and we test it both separately and in
interaction with concentration.
The interaction effect between import concentration and centrality is significant and positive
(column (1) of table 4), leaving the significance and the sign of the concentration index itself
unaffected.36This means that a high import concentration results in even higher prices for goods
whose production is strongly concentrated at the world level, as providers of more centralized
goods tend to exploit their market power.37
As concerns external reliance, we find that the index ext_rel defined in section 3.2, com-
puted, for each year and importer, as imports over exports of a certain product, has no significant
effect on relative prices both as a independent variable and in interaction with import concen-
tration (see table 26in appendix B). However, the external dependency dummy –which is equal
to 1 when a country’s imports of a certain product exceed its own exports, and 0 otherwise– is
found a significant and positive determinant of import prices, both as a separate variable and
in interaction with concentration (columns (2)-(5) of table 4). Countries that are dependent
on external suppliers as for the internal consumption of a certain product, pay a higher price
for their imports compared to economies whose exports of the same product exceed their own
imports. Importantly, a high import concentration has a more pronounced impact on import
prices for externally dependent countries.38
Overall, our results show that the positive impact of import concentration on prices is more
marked when firms’ perceived market power is strong –for goods whose production is highly
concentrated at the world level or for those that a country cannot (fully) produce by itself.

In this section, we examine the relationship between import dependency and import prices for
a subset of countries in our sample, more precisely for core advanced economies (CAE) and EU
economies. For EU economies we also investigate how import concentration affects import prices

are classified as advanced economies according to the IMF definition.39The positive relationship

for the internal consumption of a certain product. Both indices are defined in section 3.2.
As the former indicator is product-specific but not importer-specific, we interact it with the
import concentration index to study their combined effect on relative import prices.35The
latter indicator, instead, is importer- and product-specific and we test it both separately and in
interaction with concentration.
The interaction effect between import concentration and centrality is significant and positive
(column (1) of table 4), leaving the significance and the sign of the concentration index itself
unaffected.36This means that a high import concentration results in even higher prices for goods
whose production is strongly concentrated at the world level, as providers of more centralized
goods tend to exploit their market power.37
As concerns external reliance, we find that the index ext_rel defined in section 3.2, com-
puted, for each year and importer, as imports over exports of a certain product, has no significant
effect on relative prices both as a independent variable and in interaction with import concen-
tration (see table 26in appendix B). However, the external dependency dummy –which is equal
to 1 when a country’s imports of a certain product exceed its own exports, and 0 otherwise– is
found a significant and positive determinant of import prices, both as a separate variable and
in interaction with concentration (columns (2)-(5) of table 4). Countries that are dependent
on external suppliers as for the internal consumption of a certain product, pay a higher price
for their imports compared to economies whose exports of the same product exceed their own
imports. Importantly, a high import concentration has a more pronounced impact on import
prices for externally dependent countries.38
Overall, our results show that the positive impact of import concentration on prices is more
marked when firms’ perceived market power is strong –for goods whose production is highly
concentrated at the world level or for those that a country cannot (fully) produce by itself.

economies, as shown in table 5.40The results are comparable to the full country sample, with
a coefficient of HHI that is only slightly smaller in absolute size than in the baseline. All the
other coefficients are also close to baseline results.
EU countries’ trade flows also show a positive relationship between import concentration
and relative import prices, see table 5.41In the linear specification, the coefficient of HHI
estimated on EU economies only is similar in magnitude to the one estimated for the full sample
of importers. Yet, including (significant) quadratic terms and the exclusive trade relations
dummy shows that the relationship between import concentration and import prices is lower for
EU countries as compared to the full sample.
In order to investigate heterogeneous effects across intra and extra-EU trade, we split the
bilateral imports of EU countries into those vis-à-vis other EU economies and those that have
as a counterpart a country outside of the region, and calculate both the HHI index and the
relative import price index separately for each of the two markets. We find that the upward
price effect of higher concentration applies both to intra- and extra-EU trade relations, but its
strength is higher in the extra-EU market.42We also find that sourcing a certain product from
only one exporter only has a slightly significant and small impact on import prices for providers
located outside of the region, while exclusive trade relations are found to have a price-reducing
effect when suppliers are located within the single market. Also, the labor cost of exporters, as
proxied by their GDP, has a much stronger impact on prices if providers are located outside of
the EU, as labor costs differ more across extra-EU suppliers than across those located in the
single market. Therefore, strategies to switch providers to reduce costs have a greater influence
on prices in the extra- than in the intra-EU market. Finally, the market power of the importer
exerts a stronger impact on import prices in extra-EU trade as compared to what happens in
the single market.
6.5 Politically-weighted concentration
In this section, we investigate whether the upward price effect of concentration is stronger (or
weaker) if a country’s providers are politically more distanced. Or, in other words, whether
suppliers charge an additional mark-up on relative prices for importers that are more distant
from a political point of view, depending on market concentration. For this reason, we replace
in baseline regressions the HHI index with the politically-distance weighted HHI , built based
on the political distance index of Bailey et al. (2017) and defined in section 3.2. The politically-
distance weighted HHI is higher (respectively, lower) than the HHI if a countries’ imports
are more (respectively, less) concentrated in providers that are politically farther (respectively,
closer) to the importer.

as a counterpart a country outside of the region, and calculate both the HHI index and the
relative import price index separately for each of the two markets. We find that the upward
price effect of higher concentration applies both to intra- and extra-EU trade relations, but its
strength is higher in the extra-EU market.42We also find that sourcing a certain product from
only one exporter only has a slightly significant and small impact on import prices for providers
located outside of the region, while exclusive trade relations are found to have a price-reducing
effect when suppliers are located within the single market. Also, the labor cost of exporters, as
proxied by their GDP, has a much stronger impact on prices if providers are located outside of
the EU, as labor costs differ more across extra-EU suppliers than across those located in the
single market. Therefore, strategies to switch providers to reduce costs have a greater influence
on prices in the extra- than in the intra-EU market. Finally, the market power of the importer
exerts a stronger impact on import prices in extra-EU trade as compared to what happens in

We find that the significant upward price effect of import concentration still holds if we
consider the politically-weighted HHI instead of the non-weighted HHI (see table 6). Also,
the size of the estimated coefficient is very similar across the two indices of concentration, and
so are the coefficients of the other explanatory variables. One small exception is the quadratic
model with exclusive trade relations dummy, in which the quadratic term of the politically-
distance weighted concentration index is significant, contrary to the baseline. That means that
the downward effect for higher and increasing levels of concentration is more predominant when
considering the political closeness of trading partners. Apart from that, the political proximity
of suppliers does not seem to have a significant impact on relative import prices beyond the
impact of import concentration.
6.6 Robustness analysis
This section presents a number of robustness checks to our baseline model. In our robustness

43For completeness, in appendix Bwe show estimation results including additional control variables for the
market size of the importer, namely population and total GDP, see table 30. These specifications provide similar
estimates to the baseline. Most importantly, the coefficient of the concentration index is practically unaffected
by the additional control variables. In the interest of parsimony, we use the smaller model as baseline.
44We understand product complexity as a product-specific characteristic, reflecting the sophistication or knowl-
edge intensity of a given product. Product quality refers to within product’s attributes. It is generally defined
as how well a product satisfies the consumer’s needs. It can hence differ within the same product.
33between import concentration and import prices also holds when considering only core advanced
economies, as shown in table 5.40The results are comparable to the full country sample, with
a coefficient of HHI that is only slightly smaller in absolute size than in the baseline. All the
other coefficients are also close to baseline results.
EU countries’ trade flows also show a positive relationship between import concentration
and relative import prices, see table 5.41In the linear specification, the coefficient of HHI
estimated on EU economies only is similar in magnitude to the one estimated for the full sample
of importers. Yet, including (significant) quadratic terms and the exclusive trade relations
dummy shows that the relationship between import concentration and import prices is lower for
EU countries as compared to the full sample.
In order to investigate heterogeneous effects across intra and extra-EU trade, we split the
bilateral imports of EU countries into those vis-à-vis other EU economies and those that have
as a counterpart a country outside of the region, and calculate both the HHI index and the
relative import price index separately for each of the two markets. We find that the upward
price effect of higher concentration applies both to intra- and extra-EU trade relations, but its
strength is higher in the extra-EU market.42We also find that sourcing a certain product from
only one exporter only has a slightly significant and small impact on import prices for providers
located outside of the region, while exclusive trade relations are found to have a price-reducing
effect when suppliers are located within the single market. Also, the labor cost of exporters, as
proxied by their GDP, has a much stronger impact on prices if providers are located outside of
the EU, as labor costs differ more across extra-EU suppliers than across those located in the
single market. Therefore, strategies to switch providers to reduce costs have a greater influence
on prices in the extra- than in the intra-EU market. Finally, the market power of the importer
exerts a stronger impact on import prices in extra-EU trade as compared to what happens in
the single market.
6.5 Politically-weighted concentration
In this section, we investigate whether the upward price effect of concentration is stronger (or
weaker) if a country’s providers are politically more distanced. Or, in other words, whether
suppliers charge an additional mark-up on relative prices for importers that are more distant
from a political point of view, depending on market concentration. For this reason, we replace
in baseline regressions the HHI index with the politically-distance weighted HHI , built based
on the political distance index of Bailey et al. (2017) and defined in section 3.2. The politically-
distance weighted HHI is higher (respectively, lower) than the HHI if a countries’ imports
are more (respectively, less) concentrated in providers that are politically farther (respectively,
closer) to the importer.

edge intensity of a given product. Product quality refers to within product’s attributes. It is generally defined
as how well a product satisfies the consumer’s needs. It can hence differ within the same product.
33quality are taken into account in our baseline specification by two factors: importer’s per capita
GDP and importer-product FE. Per capita GDP of importers has a close tie with the quality
of imports, as richer countries usually consume higher quality goods (see Feenstra and Romalis,
2014). However, this variable reflects product quality only at the importer level, being equal
across all products. Importer-product FE control for importer-product-specific characteristics,
such as quality; they are however invariant over time and do not capture the likely impact
of a change of these characteristics on prices. That is, if an importer "upgrades" its product
quality over time, this would not be absorbed by the FE. For these reasons, we include as
additional explanatory variables product complexity and the importer’s economic complexity
(at trade). The Product Complexity Index (PCI) and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI)
from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) are, respectively, measures of the relative
knowledge intensity of a product or an economy (Simoes and Hidalgo, 2011; Hausmann and
Hidalgo, 2014). Both indices are available at the yearly frequency and the PCI is available at
the HS6-digit level, which makes them good candidates to control for the time-varying part of
the complexity of a product or an importer. We use also an interacted PCI & ECI index to
analyse the impact of importer-specific product complexity/quality on prices.45
Table 7reports the results of the linear model (see table 31in appendix Bfor the quadratic
regression results). The coefficient of our main variable of interest, import concentration HHI ,
stays highly significant and positive in all the specifications controlling for complexity. The
coefficient of product complexity PCI, i.e. complexity at the product level, reveals a significant,
if small, negative impact on relative import prices (column (1)). This means that an increase in
the sophistication of a product weighs on its relative import price. We explain this result by the
fact that more complex products exhibit a smaller range of relative price differences than less
complex products (see figure 10in appendix B).46Also, the coefficient of the ECI of importers
shows a significant negative impact on relative price levels (column (2)). The variable is however
highly correlated with per capita GDP of importers47, whose coefficient increases approximately
by the same size as the absolute size of the coefficient of ECI compared to the benchmark. We
hence presume that multicollinearity (overfitting) between the two variables could be an issue
here, which makes it difficult to isolate the effects of the two variables. Finally, column (4)
shows a slightly positive and significant (at the 10% significance level) impact of the interacted
product and economy complexity on import prices. We take this as confirmation that importer-
specific product characteristics, which we summarize as "quality", have a small positive impact
on relative import prices.
Controlling for China’s integration in global markets Next, we investigate how import-
ing from China affects the relationship between import concentration and import prices. China
has become a dominant provider for many products in world trade (Jean et al., 2023). One
possible explanation could be that China offers lower prices beyond what could be expected
45As the PCI and ECI are only available for a smaller number of products than our full product sample, the
sample size is slightly reduced with respect to baseline estimations.
46As we are more interested in relative price differences between importers (at the product level), and not
between products, we only show this result for illustrative purposes.

Hidalgo, 2014). Both indices are available at the yearly frequency and the PCI is available at
the HS6-digit level, which makes them good candidates to control for the time-varying part of
the complexity of a product or an importer. We use also an interacted PCI & ECI index to
analyse the impact of importer-specific product complexity/quality on prices.45
Table 7reports the results of the linear model (see table 31in appendix Bfor the quadratic
regression results). The coefficient of our main variable of interest, import concentration HHI ,
stays highly significant and positive in all the specifications controlling for complexity. The
coefficient of product complexity PCI, i.e. complexity at the product level, reveals a significant,
if small, negative impact on relative import prices (column (1)). This means that an increase in
the sophistication of a product weighs on its relative import price. We explain this result by the
fact that more complex products exhibit a smaller range of relative price differences than less
complex products (see figure 10in appendix B).46Also, the coefficient of the ECI of importers
shows a significant negative impact on relative price levels (column (2)). The variable is however
highly correlated with per capita GDP of importers47, whose coefficient increases approximately
by the same size as the absolute size of the coefficient of ECI compared to the benchmark. We
hence presume that multicollinearity (overfitting) between the two variables could be an issue
here, which makes it difficult to isolate the effects of the two variables. Finally, column (4)
shows a slightly positive and significant (at the 10% significance level) impact of the interacted
product and economy complexity on import prices. We take this as confirmation that importer-
specific product characteristics, which we summarize as "quality", have a small positive impact
on relative import prices.
Controlling for China’s integration in global markets Next, we investigate how import-
ing from China affects the relationship between import concentration and import prices. China
has become a dominant provider for many products in world trade (Jean et al., 2023). One
possible explanation could be that China offers lower prices beyond what could be expected
45As the PCI and ECI are only available for a smaller number of products than our full product sample, the
sample size is slightly reduced with respect to baseline estimations.
46As we are more interested in relative price differences between importers (at the product level), and not
between products, we only show this result for illustrative purposes.
47This high correlation is also well documented by Hausmann and Hidalgo (2014 ).
35from its level of labor costs (controlled for in our baseline model by weighted exporter’s GDP).
With an increasing import concentration towards China in our sample period (see section 5),
this could result in a negative association between concentration and prices, that could affect
the coefficient of the concentration index. We therefore introduce an additional control variable
into the regression that represents China’s market share at the importer-product-year level. A
negative coefficient would indeed speak in favor of a downward price effect of sourcing from
China (a "China effect"), while a positive coefficient would rather support the assumption of a
(profit-maximizing) market power effect.48
Table 8shows that our baseline result concerning the positive impact of import concentration
HHI on prices proves to be robust to the inclusion of China’s share in exports.49Also, China’s
share in exports has a significant positive influence on relative import prices at the importer-
product-year level. The market power effect seems to clearly outweigh a possible "China effect"
(i.e., a below-average price level not explained by the economic development/labor costs of
China). This result is in line with Jean et al. (2023 ), who also find that Chinese exporters do
set higher prices when they enjoy a higher market share.
Controlling for import tariffs Third, we test whether bilateral tariffs effectively applied by
each importer (bundled across exporters using as weights their shares in the imports of each
product) affect the impact of concentration on relative prices.50The idea is to control for the
fact that exporters could charge a lower price (compared to "world market prices" for a given
product) to compensate for higher tariffs applied by a certain importer. While the inclusion of
this variable does not change the coefficient of HHI , the coefficient of effectively applied tariffs
is not significant in any of the specifications (see table 9).
Employing lagged HHI Reverse causality could be an issue to the extent that countries
that pay a higher price for their imports of a certain product compared to other importers,
decide to reshape their network of providers so as to lower import costs, with an impact on their
import concentration. In order to control for this possible effect, we use lagged values of the HHI
in baseline regressions. Table 10reports results for a specification using previous year HHIs,
while table 32in appendix Bemploys three-year-lagged HHIs. Both sets of results show that
the positive impact of concentration on prices still holds –and significantly so– when measuring
import concentration through previous years values, which suggests that our results are robust
to possible reverse causality issues.
48The sample is reduced to products that are exported by China. It is also possible that the integration of
China into world markets exerted downward pressure on the general price level. However, this effect is already
controlled for in our empirical strategy by the fact that we are looking at relative and not absolute price levels.
49The estimated coefficient of HHI decreases somewhat in absolute size in the linear specification. This is not
surprising, as the concentration towards China is now controlled for by an additional variable.
50Contrary to Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariffs, effectively applied tariffs take into account the existence of
preferential trade agreements between countries, which can lower applied duties below their MFN level.

We find that the significant upward price effect of import concentration still holds if we
consider the politically-weighted HHI instead of the non-weighted HHI (see table 6). Also,
the size of the estimated coefficient is very similar across the two indices of concentration, and
so are the coefficients of the other explanatory variables. One small exception is the quadratic
model with exclusive trade relations dummy, in which the quadratic term of the politically-
distance weighted concentration index is significant, contrary to the baseline. That means that
the downward effect for higher and increasing levels of concentration is more predominant when
considering the political closeness of trading partners. Apart from that, the political proximity
of suppliers does not seem to have a significant impact on relative import prices beyond the
impact of import concentration.
6.6 Robustness analysis
This section presents a number of robustness checks to our baseline model. In our robustness
analyses, we control for product complexity; for China’s integration in global markets; for ef-
fective tariffs applied by the importer; we use lagged HHIs as well as concentration indices
alternative to the HHI; and we implement a battery of alternative FE structures. Our baseline
results prove robust to all these exercises, as detailed in the following paragraphs.43
Controlling for product complexity First, we provide additional controls for product &
importers economic complexity as well as product quality.44Product complexity and product
43For completeness, in appendix Bwe show estimation results including additional control variables for the
market size of the importer, namely population and total GDP, see table 30. These specifications provide similar
estimates to the baseline. Most importantly, the coefficient of the concentration index is practically unaffected
by the additional control variables. In the interest of parsimony, we use the smaller model as baseline.
44We understand product complexity as a product-specific characteristic, reflecting the sophistication or knowl-
edge intensity of a given product. Product quality refers to within product’s attributes. It is generally defined
as how well a product satisfies the consumer’s needs. It can hence differ within the same product.

Employing alternative concentration measures We then explore the sensitivity of our re-
sults to the use of alternative concentration indices. First, we replace the HHI with a Herfindahl-
Hirschman index built using bilateral trade flows expressed in quantity terms, instead than in
USD as in our baseline analysis, using data from CEPII-BACI. As granular bilateral quantity-
based trade flows data are of a lower quality than value-based data, our baseline estimations,
as well as the descriptive analysis in section 5, are based on the latter measure, in line with the
literature (European Commission (2021), Arjona et al. (2023), Ioannou and Perez (2023)). Yet,
columns (1) and (2) of table 11test the robustness of our results to the use of an alternative HHI
built using quantity-based data. In columns (3) and (4) we use instead as an alternative measure
of import concentration the concentration ratio of the first two providers (CR2), computed as
the sum of their export shares, as in Covarrubias et al. (2020).51Finally, columns (5) and (6)
employ as an alternative measure of import concentration the Theil’s entropy index, as Cadot
et al. (2014), which is defined as:
T heilpc
imp=1
n·N∑
exp=1Mpc
imp,exp
µpc
imp·lnMpc
imp,exp
µpc
imp, (9)
where nis the number of potential exporters of product pc, defined as in Cadot et al. (2014) as
countries that export pcfor at least two consecutive years, and µpc
impis the average of country’s
imp imports of product pcover all the potential exporters.
As shown in table 11, the positive impact of import concentration on prices is robust to the
use of the three alternative concentration measures.52
Alternative FE structures Finally, in a last robustness check, we employ three different
fixed effect strategies, to check for the robustness of our baseline results to the time-invariant
intercept of each unit. First, we use separate product, importer and time FE, which control
individually for time-invariant country-specific factors, time-invariant product-specific factors
(e.g. non-importer specific product characteristics) and time-specific intercepts. Second, we
employ interacted importer-time FE, which control for omitted time-varying importer-specific
fluctuations (macro shocks, exchange rate fluctuations, etc.) as well as product FE. Third, we
use importer-sector-time FE, identifying sectors at the HS 2-digit level. In the latter two settings,
importer’s per capita GDP proves to be strongly collinear with importer-time FE, and is hence
omitted from the estimation. Results are presented in table 12. The sign and significance of
the relation between relative prices and concentration is robust to the different FE structures,
as concentration has a positive impact on relative prices. However, the size of the coefficient
increases considerably compared to the baseline in the first two alternative FE strategies. An
increase of the concentration index by 0.1 point increases relative import prices by about 0.02
51Covarrubias et al. (2020) employ the concentration ratio of the first 8 providers (CR8), as their analysis is
at the provider-firm level.
52The main results on the evolution of import concentration outlined in section 5are also robust to the use of
these alternative indices of concentration. Results are available upon request.

39Employing alternative concentration measures We then explore the sensitivity of our re-
sults to the use of alternative concentration indices. First, we replace the HHI with a Herfindahl-
Hirschman index built using bilateral trade flows expressed in quantity terms, instead than in
USD as in our baseline analysis, using data from CEPII-BACI. As granular bilateral quantity-
based trade flows data are of a lower quality than value-based data, our baseline estimations,
as well as the descriptive analysis in section 5, are based on the latter measure, in line with the
literature (European Commission (2021), Arjona et al. (2023), Ioannou and Perez (2023)). Yet,
columns (1) and (2) of table 11test the robustness of our results to the use of an alternative HHI
built using quantity-based data. In columns (3) and (4) we use instead as an alternative measure
of import concentration the concentration ratio of the first two providers (CR2), computed as
the sum of their export shares, as in Covarrubias et al. (2020).51Finally, columns (5) and (6)
employ as an alternative measure of import concentration the Theil’s entropy index, as Cadot
et al. (2014), which is defined as:
T heilpc
imp=1
n·N∑

where nis the number of potential exporters of product pc, defined as in Cadot et al. (2014) as
countries that export pcfor at least two consecutive years, and µpc
impis the average of country’s
imp imports of product pcover all the potential exporters.
As shown in table 11, the positive impact of import concentration on prices is robust to the
use of the three alternative concentration measures.52
Alternative FE structures Finally, in a last robustness check, we employ three different
fixed effect strategies, to check for the robustness of our baseline results to the time-invariant
intercept of each unit. First, we use separate product, importer and time FE, which control
individually for time-invariant country-specific factors, time-invariant product-specific factors
(e.g. non-importer specific product characteristics) and time-specific intercepts. Second, we
employ interacted importer-time FE, which control for omitted time-varying importer-specific
fluctuations (macro shocks, exchange rate fluctuations, etc.) as well as product FE. Third, we
use importer-sector-time FE, identifying sectors at the HS 2-digit level. In the latter two settings,
importer’s per capita GDP proves to be strongly collinear with importer-time FE, and is hence
omitted from the estimation. Results are presented in table 12. The sign and significance of
the relation between relative prices and concentration is robust to the different FE structures,
as concentration has a positive impact on relative prices. However, the size of the coefficient
increases considerably compared to the baseline in the first two alternative FE strategies. An
increase of the concentration index by 0.1 point increases relative import prices by about 0.02
51Covarrubias et al. (2020) employ the concentration ratio of the first 8 providers (CR8), as their analysis is
at the provider-firm level.

these alternative indices of concentration. Results are available upon request.

appendix B.
We find that the significant upward price effect of import concentration still holds if we
consider the politically-weighted HHI instead of the non-weighted HHI (see table 6). Also,
the size of the estimated coefficient is very similar across the two indices of concentration, and
so are the coefficients of the other explanatory variables. One small exception is the quadratic
model with exclusive trade relations dummy, in which the quadratic term of the politically-
distance weighted concentration index is significant, contrary to the baseline. That means that
the downward effect for higher and increasing levels of concentration is more predominant when
considering the political closeness of trading partners. Apart from that, the political proximity
of suppliers does not seem to have a significant impact on relative import prices beyond the
impact of import concentration.
6.6 Robustness analysis
This section presents a number of robustness checks to our baseline model. In our robustness
analyses, we control for product complexity; for China’s integration in global markets; for ef-
fective tariffs applied by the importer; we use lagged HHIs as well as concentration indices
alternative to the HHI; and we implement a battery of alternative FE structures. Our baseline
results prove robust to all these exercises, as detailed in the following paragraphs.43
Controlling for product complexity First, we provide additional controls for product &
importers economic complexity as well as product quality.44Product complexity and product
43For completeness, in appendix Bwe show estimation results including additional control variables for the
market size of the importer, namely population and total GDP, see table 30. These specifications provide similar
estimates to the baseline. Most importantly, the coefficient of the concentration index is practically unaffected
by the additional control variables. In the interest of parsimony, we use the smaller model as baseline.
44We understand product complexity as a product-specific characteristic, reflecting the sophistication or knowl-
edge intensity of a given product. Product quality refers to within product’s attributes. It is generally defined
as how well a product satisfies the consumer’s needs. It can hence differ within the same product.

42point in the linear model (columns (1) and (3)). We interpret this finding as signaling that
this FE structure controls less for (importer-specific) differences within the individual products.
Therefore, a larger part of the variability of relative prices within each individual product is
attributed to concentration (and other explanatory variables, whose coefficients also increase in
absolute size). Columns (3) and (4) of table show that controlling for importer-specific time-
shocks, beyond the level of GDP, does not add anything to the model. Likewise, controlling
for importer-time-sector FE at the HS2-level increases the coefficient of HHI slightly, but has
otherwise only a minor impact on results, as shown in columns (5) and (6).

7 Conclusions
Recent events have shown that highly concentrated imports can represent a source of vulnerabil-
ity for the importer, which motivates a tendency towards import diversification.53In this paper,
we study the evolution of import concentration in OECD countries in the last two decades, high-
53Although evident in some policy measures adopted by key economies and in firms’ surveys, some recent works
point at that this tendency is being implemented slowly at the firm level. See, for instance, (de Lucio, Díaz-Mora,
Mínguez, Minondo, and Requena, 2023).
43Employing alternative concentration measures We then explore the sensitivity of our re-
sults to the use of alternative concentration indices. First, we replace the HHI with a Herfindahl-
Hirschman index built using bilateral trade flows expressed in quantity terms, instead than in
USD as in our baseline analysis, using data from CEPII-BACI. As granular bilateral quantity-
based trade flows data are of a lower quality than value-based data, our baseline estimations,
as well as the descriptive analysis in section 5, are based on the latter measure, in line with the
literature (European Commission (2021), Arjona et al. (2023), Ioannou and Perez (2023)). Yet,
columns (1) and (2) of table 11test the robustness of our results to the use of an alternative HHI
built using quantity-based data. In columns (3) and (4) we use instead as an alternative measure
of import concentration the concentration ratio of the first two providers (CR2), computed as
the sum of their export shares, as in Covarrubias et al. (2020).51Finally, columns (5) and (6)
employ as an alternative measure of import concentration the Theil’s entropy index, as Cadot
et al. (2014), which is defined as:
T heilpc
imp=1
n·N∑
exp=1Mpc
imp,exp
µpc
imp·lnMpc
imp,exp
µpc
imp, (9)
where nis the number of potential exporters of product pc, defined as in Cadot et al. (2014) as
countries that export pcfor at least two consecutive years, and µpc
impis the average of country’s
imp imports of product pcover all the potential exporters.
As shown in table 11, the positive impact of import concentration on prices is robust to the
use of the three alternative concentration measures.52
Alternative FE structures Finally, in a last robustness check, we employ three different
fixed effect strategies, to check for the robustness of our baseline results to the time-invariant
intercept of each unit. First, we use separate product, importer and time FE, which control
individually for time-invariant country-specific factors, time-invariant product-specific factors
(e.g. non-importer specific product characteristics) and time-specific intercepts. Second, we
employ interacted importer-time FE, which control for omitted time-varying importer-specific
fluctuations (macro shocks, exchange rate fluctuations, etc.) as well as product FE. Third, we
use importer-sector-time FE, identifying sectors at the HS 2-digit level. In the latter two settings,
importer’s per capita GDP proves to be strongly collinear with importer-time FE, and is hence
omitted from the estimation. Results are presented in table 12. The sign and significance of
the relation between relative prices and concentration is robust to the different FE structures,
as concentration has a positive impact on relative prices. However, the size of the coefficient
increases considerably compared to the baseline in the first two alternative FE strategies. An
increase of the concentration index by 0.1 point increases relative import prices by about 0.02
51Covarrubias et al. (2020) employ the concentration ratio of the first 8 providers (CR8), as their analysis is
at the provider-firm level.
52The main results on the evolution of import concentration outlined in section 5are also robust to the use of
these alternative indices of concentration. Results are available upon request.

this FE structure controls less for (importer-specific) differences within the individual products.
Therefore, a larger part of the variability of relative prices within each individual product is
attributed to concentration (and other explanatory variables, whose coefficients also increase in
absolute size). Columns (3) and (4) of table show that controlling for importer-specific time-
shocks, beyond the level of GDP, does not add anything to the model. Likewise, controlling
for importer-time-sector FE at the HS2-level increases the coefficient of HHI slightly, but has
otherwise only a minor impact on results, as shown in columns (5) and (6).

43lighting the role of China as a leading global exporter and the role of the EU internal market
as a source of diversification for European economies. We also investigate the impact of import
concentration on import prices, finding a positive relationship, which is compatible with the
view that highly concentrated markets are associated to a lower level of competition –although
results are heterogeneous across industries.
Our results have relevant policy implications. As it has been shown in recent contributions
(IRC ,2024), a potential deepening of geopolitical tensions in the next years could entail infla-
tionary consequences at the world level. Our results –showing that countries whose imports
are highly concentrated tend to pay more, everything else equal, to source the same product–
suggest that import diversification could mitigate these upward pressures on prices. Recent
contributions have also documented that a selective process of trade fragmentation along geopo-
litical lines could already be under way (Gopinath, 2023; International Monetary Fund, 2024;
Fernandez-Villaverde et al., 2024). Our results indicate that, in this context of trade flows reallo-
cation, it is important that shifts away from geopolitically-distant exporters to be coupled with
effective diversification across alternative providers, as diversification itself could contribute to
contain import prices. Finally, some works have also found recent evidence of a tendency towards
a regionalization of trade flows (IRC ,2024; Alicke, Foster, Hauck, and Trautwein, 2023). In light
of this trend, our findings suggest that regionalization –that is, an increase in concentration on
a regional basis– could likely result in a lower competition and higher prices.
