EU Strategic Dependencies:  
A Long View
Summary
We analyze how trade dependencies have evolved over time to better understand how they relate to vulnerabilities.
We focus on the EU-27 and apply the bottom-up approach laid out by the European Commission (EC) using trade data 
from 1996 to 2019.
The number of dependent products has shown no clear pattern since the mid-1990s, nor has their sectoral composition. 
The geography of dependencies has, however, evolved towards dependencies concentrated on Chinese suppliers, but 
this shift had already occurred in 2010.
The products identified as dependent exhibit significant churning over time: one out of five dependent products in 2018 
was not identified as such one year later in 2019 and close to half of dependent products in 2014 were not identified 
as such five years later.

EU Strategic Dependencies: A Long ViewThe Covid-19 pandemic and resulting congestion of global 
supply chains have reignited a focus on dependencies 
arising from trade openness. In the wake of the pandemic, 
both the European Commission and the US government have 
conducted reviews of their supply chains to identify strategic 
dependencies, i.e. products for which they depend on foreign 
suppliers in strategic ecosystems. The war in Ukraine 
and weaponization of gas exports by Russia have further 
contributed to shift the focus from gains from trade openness 
to vulnerabilities arising from trade specialization. They have 
also changed the conception of vulnerabilities arising from 
dependencies, from exogenous risks of disruption due to 
pandemics or natural disasters to the risk of dependencies 
being weaponized by foreign governments in trade disputes 
and coercion. 
In this policy brief, we take a step back from current 
dependencies and look at their evolution over time. The 
definition, measurement and scope of the risks associated 
with trade links are still widely debated, and constitute an 
area of ongoing work. Here, we 
focus on the EU-27 and apply the 
bottom-up approach laid out by 
the European Commission (EC) to 
identify 137 products in the most 
sensitive ecosystems in 2018 (EC, 
2021).1 Such dependent goods are 
just a first step in the mapping of 
strategic vulnerabilities. In that 
respect, in order to assess their 
consequences, it is useful to understand how dependencies 
developed and whether they are a stable pattern of the world 
trading system. Taking a long view at trade relationships 
also helps understanding of the specificities of the current 
global environment.
The EC (2021) assesses dependent products from the importer 
point of view, taking into account the concentration of imports, 
their importance in demand and their substitutability. Such an 
approach is broadly similar to other proposed identification 
criteria; the main criteria used however focus on the importer 
side and disregards concentration on the export side. Using 
those criteria, we ask whether strategic dependencies are 
a new phenomenon or whether the global environment 
and perception of underlying risks have changed. No clear 
pattern emerges in that respect since the mid-1990s in terms 
of the number of dependent products. The geography of 
dependencies, however, has evolved towards dependencies 
concentrated on Chinese suppliers, which suggests that, 
while dependencies are a structural feature of the trading 
system, the perception of the risks associated with it has 
changed. Interestingly, the shift towards dependencies from 
Chinese suppliers dates back to the early 2010s but started 
(1) Before the EC report, Bonneau and Nakaa (2020) and Jaravel and Méjean 
(2021) proposed classifications of dependent products based on alternative 
criteria. See section 1. to be perceived as a source of vulnerabilities almost a 
decade later.
Another important dimension to be considered when mapping 
dependencies into vulnerabilities is the lasting nature of 
product-level dependencies. For trade dependencies to 
generate strategic vulnerabilities, 
they need to be long-lasting and 
structural. The fact that dependent 
products vary from one year to the 
next means that their sourcing is 
volatile, which reduces the risk 
of supply disruptions because 
of a single country or firm. The 
products identified as dependent 
exhibit significant churning over 
time: one out of five dependent 
products in 2018 was not identified as such one year later in 
2019 and close to half of dependent products in 2014 were not 
identified as such five years later. Such variability over short 
horizons calls into question the vulnerabilities associated with 
dependent products identified through specific criteria.
     1. The bottom-up approach of the 
European Commission
The European Commission’s methodology, presented in the 
‘Strategic dependencies and capacities’ report (EC, 2021), 
combines three criteria measuring different dimensions of 
dependencies (Table 1): 1) concentration of extra-EU imports, 
2) the importance of demand and 3) the substitutability with EU 
production. The first criterion is computed for each imported 
product as a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measuring the 
concentration of European imports over all trading partners. 
The HHI is the sum of squared market shares of European 
imports from country i, over all trading partners. In this case, 
a product is defined as concentrated when the HHI of the 
corresponding imports is larger than 0.4. The second criterion 
is the share of extra-European imports over total European 
imports. The corresponding threshold is set to 0.5, identifying 
products in high demand. The third criterion is the ratio of 
extra-European imports over total European exports; the 
product is considered as not substitutable when the ratio is 
larger than 1.
Considering, for example, the year 2019 (first year of the 
report) and over 4,726 products, the first criterion alone 
identifies 1,374 products, the second 1,564, and the third 773. 
Combining all three criteria, 353 products are defined as 
dependent. It is worth noting that not all three criteria are 
similarly binding: in particular, when the third criterion applies, 
the second one always does. Hence, only criteria 1 and 3 
define dependent products. 
The EC then restricts the identified products to those 
pertaining to sensitive ecosystems, including aerospace and such dependent 
goods are just a 
first step in the 
mapping of strategic 
vulnerabilitiesThe geography of 
dependencies has 
evolved towards 
dependencies 
concentrated on 
Chinese suppliers
CEPII  – Policy Brief  No 41  – June 2023      3 
Policy Briefdefense, electronics, energy-intensive industries, renewable 
energy, health, and digital industries. Since we do not have 
the definition of these ecosystems, we focus on the products 
identified by the first three criteria without restricting them to 
sensitive ecosystems. The EC also considers two additional 
criteria to assess the diversification potential of dependent 
products through an HHI of exports by products, and a price 
differential between extra-EU imports 
and total EU exports.2 Those are not 
used to identify dependent products in 
the EC (2021) methodology but to qualify 
dependent products identified, so we 
disregard them in the following. 
Alternative criteria have been proposed to 
identify dependent products, in particular 
by the French Treasury (Bonneau and 
Nakaa, 2020), the French Council of 
Economics (Jaravel and Méjean, 2021), and CESifo (Baur 
and Flach, 2022). All four studies have in common the level of 
concentration of imports (Table 1). The first three studies also 
consider the level of extra-EU imports. The substitutability of 
imports by domestic production is adopted by both the EC 
and CESifo studies (criteria 3), while both French studies 
build on a proxy for supply concentration. Jaravel and Méjean 
(2021) proxy the concentration of suppliers ( i.e. exporters), 
at the firm level, by the number of French firms importing the 
products. Indeed, the economic literature has shown that a 
firm generally imports from only a few foreign exporting firms; 
hence, if the imports rely on only one French firm, they also 
rely on a few foreign suppliers, increasing the risk of supply 
(2) Similar indicators of diversification potential can be found in Bonneau and 
Nakaa (2020) and Baur and Flach (2022).disruption. Bonneau and Nakaa (2020) consider a centrality 
risk measure, which proxies the potential for diversification 
across exporting countries. In both cases, the idea is to 
capture the level of production concentration of the product 
considered. This is also the goal of one of the additional 
criteria the EC is using, by computing the HHI of world exports 
to capture the diversification potential. 
Baur and Flach (2022) introduce another 
criterion to take into account the relevance 
of the good for domestic production, 
which would put the focus on intermediate 
goods rather than downstream goods 
aimed at final consumption. To that end, 
they consider the five largest sectors 
in Germany (machinery, cars, metals, 
chemicals and electronics) and identify 
the three most important inputs of the final 
goods produced in each sector, using input-output tables.
Overall, these studies build on similar criteria to identify 
products for which domestic imports are concentrated on 
a small number of suppliers. Additional criteria regarding 
the importance of imports in domestic production, their 
substitutability with domestic production or the concentration 
of exports are specific to studies presented in Table 1. In 
particular, the EC does not consider the concentration of 
exports in its main criteria.
In the following section, we use detailed product-level trade 
data from the BACI database in HS-1996 nomenclature 
(Gaulier and Zignago, 2010) and apply all three criteria used 
by the EC for every year over the period 1996–2019.3

EU Strategic Dependencies: A Long View     2. Dependent products over time
The number of dependent products varies over time, from 
300 at its lowest level to 420 products at its highest, but no 
specific trend emerges: the number of dependent products 
increases over the period 2007–2015, but comes back to 
the level reached in the 1990s from 2016 on (Figure 1). 
Such stability in the extent 
of dependencies raises the 
question of potential changes in 
their composition, and therefore 
the risk associated with specific 
dependencies. We therefore 
focus on two dimensions along 
which dependencies may have 
changed over time: sectors and 
country of origin.
We first split the product identified by broad sectors of activity, 
distinguishing seven sectors likely related to the strategic 
ecosystems mentioned by the EC: agrifood, chemicals, health, 
steel, defense and aerospace, transport and electronics.4 
In 2019 the seven sectors yield 134 products, close to the 
137 products identified in EC (2021), distributed as follows: 
4 in agrifood, 77 in chemicals, 11 in health, 17 in steel, 2 in 
defense and aerospace, 1 in transport and 22 in electronics. 
This distribution is quite stable over time but for the share of 
chemical products increasing slightly and that of electronics 
decreasing (Figure 2). Other dependent products concentrate 
over the manufacturing sector ( e.g. yarn fabrics) or animal 
products (mainly meat and fish).
Focusing on specific products that are at the top of the current 
policy agenda, semi-conductors enter the list of dependent 
(4) We use the CEPII-Chelem industry classification . The health industry 
includes pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, including active components 
upstream in the production chain as defined in Cotterlaz et al.  (2022). Note 
that we use the 1996 HS nomenclature throughout our time period in order to 
have a stable number of products. Some “new” product categories may not be 
adequately captured. products in 2002 and remain on it until 2019.5 Rare metals 
are also a constant feature of dependent products; several 
are included in the list since 1996, in particular borates, 
scandium and cobalt.6 The specific case of solar panels is 
worth mentioning: this product7 is identified as dependent 
between 2010 and 2012 and then in 2019 only. Interestingly, 
in December 2013, the European Union imposed a provisional 
anti-dumping tariff on solar panels imported from China. The 
temporary trade protection was lifted in September 2018, after 
which solar panels return to the list of dependent products. 
This underlines that trade protection has an impact on strategic 
dependencies, by reducing the level of imports of a particular 
product, but also by artificially hiding a dependence. 
The pervasiveness of the status of specific products that 
feature high on the policy agenda on strategic dependencies 
currently, draws to attention the 
monitoring of such dependencies 
and/or the evolution of perception 
of risks associated with such 
dependencies.8 One aspect of these 
risks relates to the geographic origin 
of imports. 
The map of EU dependencies, 
based on the top country of origin 
for each dependent product, shows 
a clear shift in the origin toward China (Figure 3). While it 
was already in the top three origins in 1996, China was the 
main exporter of only 50 dependent products in 1996 ( i.e. 1/6 
of total EU dependent products). Since 2010 it has been the

(electronic integrated circuits) and 8541 (diodes, transistors and similar semi-
conductor devices).

Policy Briefmain source of around 150 dependent 
products (almost half of dependent 
products). For comparison, the share of 
China in EU imports was 7.3% in 2010 
and 8.8% in 2020. In 2019, 50 dependent 
products were sourced primarily from the 
USA and only 30 from India.9 The total 
share of the top three origin countries 
increased, as they supplied 150 of the 
dependent products in 1996 and supply 
more than 200 today, mainly due to the 
increasing share of Chinese products. 
Overall, we document limited changes 
in the number of dependent products 
– if anything a decrease over the last 
decade – and sectoral composition 
for the EU over the period 1996–2019. 
However, the bilateral dimension of 
dependencies has changed, as illustrated 
by the concentration in the origin of 
imports of dependent products on China. 
This reflects the increasing share of 
China in world trade, especially for highly 
concentrated products. Considering the 
top 10% most concentrated products in 
world exports, China appears in the first 
five exporters for 249 of them in 1996 but 
527 in 2019. This calls into question the potential for supplier 
diversification given the concentration of production and 
exports in China for such a large number of products.
(9) Other countries like Morocco and Philippines also appear in the top three 
in the mid-2010s; the dependent products concerned are mainly agricultural 
products and textile, and electronics in the case of Philippines.Moreover, the trading regime has changed radically over 
the past three decades, affecting the comparison of trade 
dependencies over time. In particular, during the hyper-
globalization period of the 1990s and 2000s, the emergence 
of global value chains increased the overall reliance of 
national economies on foreign production, both as a source Figure 2 – Dependent products by sector

EU Strategic Dependencies: A Long Viewof intermediate and final goods. For the EU-27, trade 
openness increased from 22% of GDP in 1996 to 34% in 
2012. The 2010s, however, were characterized by a plateau 
of globalization so that, in 2019, EU trade openness still stood 
at 34%.10 Such a dimension of dependency is not picked up by 
any criterion used to identify dependent products in Table 1. 
However, it further underlines that, while the landscape of 
dependencies has changed from 1996 to 2012, most of the 
characteristics of dependencies in 2019 were already in place 
after the global financial crisis, including the concentration of 
imports of dependent products from China.
Such stable patterns of dependency draw attention to 
the delayed policy response throughout the 2010s – and 
all the more since geopolitical risks and challenges to 
the world trading system were already 
intensifying compared to the pre-global 
financial crisis period. Caldara and 
Iacoviello (2022) document already larger 
average geopolitical risks over the 2010s 
compared to the late 2000s, outside major 
armed conflicts in 2001 and 2014. The 
rule-based international trading system 
was also already under stress, notably 
through the US blocking of the renewal of 
judges of the appeals body of the WTO 
dispute settlement mechanism, starting with the Obama 
administration. Such challenges to the international trading 
system and the protectionist turn have obviously increased 
following the election of Donald Trump, but they were already 
evident before that. The Chinese export embargo on rare 
earth to Japan was also an early weaponization of trade ties

Thailand and the Fukushima catastrophe in Japan in 2011 – 
also paralyzed specific regions and industries such as the 
electronics and automotive industry, with consequences down 
the supply chain worldwide. 
     3. The (in)stability of dependent 
products
The relative stability in the total number of dependent 
products, highlighted in the previous section, hides a 
significant churning of specific dependent products over 
time over the last two decades. Taking 2019 as a reference 
year, Figure 4 shows whether the products 
identified as dependent in 2019 (represented 
by grey bars) were dependent in the years before. 
Over the period 1996–2019 dependent products 
vary significantly: 22% of dependent products 
in 2018 were not tagged as dependent just one 
year later in 2019. At a longer horizon, 46% of 
products identified as dependent in 2014 were 
not dependent five years later. Such churning 
resonates with the overall short median duration 
of export spells at the firm (Berthou and 
Vicard, 2015) and country level (Besedes and Prusa, 2006). 
In addition, this churning could be explained by market 
concentration changes. 
Such large year-on-year churning of dependent products calls 
into question the definition and interpretation of dependencies. 
Vulnerabilities related to dependencies on foreign production 
are by nature a medium or long-term issue, which is relevant 
to the extent that there is no alternative or substitute in the Figure 4 – Churning of dependent products

Policy Briefanymore (all three together or the substitutability criterion). 
This further underlines that the identification of dependent 
products rests primarily on two criteria – concentration of 
imports and substitutability with EU production – and that the 
variability of dependent products is not related to a single 
criterion.
     Conclusion
Applying the criteria used by the European Commission to 
identify dependent products back 
to 1996, this policy brief shows 
that trade dependencies are 
not a new phenomenon, nor is 
their sectoral composition. What 
has changed is the geography 
of EU dependencies, with 
increased sourcing from China. 
Such patterns underline that it 
is not the underlying structure 
of dependencies that has 
changed but the perceived risks 
associated with them because 
of the concentration of imports 
of dependent products from a 
source country, China, that is now considered less aligned 
geopolitically to the EU, and/or increasing risks of supply-
chain disruption due to pandemics or natural disasters.
The shift in the source of dependent products, however, 
occurred a decade ago, which reminds us that the renewed 
focus of the EU on its strategic vulnerabilities results from 
a shift in the perception of the consequences of trade 
relationships rather than the build-up of new dependencies. 
It underlines the need to focus on identifying risks associated 
with specific products, related to the concentration of 
production worldwide, its location and the products involved 
in its value chains. 
Furthermore, the variability, even with short horizons, of the 
list of products identified as dependent should be considered 
when mapping dependencies to vulnerabilities, which by 
definition are long-term issues addressed by structural 
policies. In particular, import concentration features year-to-
year variability – a pattern that should be taken into account 
when thinking about the identification of vulnerabilities. domestic market or abroad. In this context, year-to-year 
changes in dependent products calls into question the potential 
vulnerabilities associated with such import dependencies. 
The volatility in dependent products based on a year-on-year 
definition may be too large to 
back policy changes. One could 
think of applying the same 
criteria on a rolling window 
to obtain medium-run trends 
that would be better suited to 
support European policies.
Going further, we focus on the 
dependent products identified in 
2018, and explore which criteria 
explain why some of them no 
longer qualify as dependent 
products in 2019 (60 products 
out of 334). Figure 5 presents 
the distribution of these 2018 
dependent products according 
to whether they failed to meet one, two or all three of the 
criteria in 2019. Among these products, we find that, for almost 
two thirds of them, the import concentration index has fallen 
back below the threshold (37 products), more than half have 
a substitution criterion lower than unity in 2019 (32 products), 
and seven had a switch in the EU demand criterion but
